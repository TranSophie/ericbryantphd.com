  abstract = {The CKS1B gene located on chromosome 1q21 is frequently amplified in breast, lung, and liver cancers. CKS1B codes for a conserved regulatory subunit of cyclin-CDK complexes that function at multiple stages of cell cycle progression. We used a high throughput screening protocol to mimic cancer-related overexpression in a library of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants to identify genes whose functions become essential only when CKS1 is overexpressed, a synthetic dosage lethal (SDL) interaction. Mutations in multiple genes affecting mitotic entry and mitotic exit are highly enriched in the set of SDL interactions. The interactions between Cks1 and the mitotic entry checkpoint genes require the inhibitory activity of Swe1 on the yeast cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), Cdc28. In addition, the SDL interactions of overexpressed CKS1 with mutations in the mitotic exit network are suppressed by modulating expression of the CDK inhibitor Sic1. Mutation of the polo-like kinase Cdc5, which functions in both the mitotic entry and mitotic exit pathways, is lethal in combination with overexpressed CKS1 Therefore we investigated the effect of targeting the human Cdc5 ortholog, PLK1, in breast cancers with various expression levels of human CKS1B Growth inhibition by PLK1 knockdown correlates with increased CKS1B expression in published tumor cell data sets, and this correlation was confirmed using shRNAs against PLK1 in tumor cell lines. In addition, we overexpressed CKS1B in multiple cell lines and found increased sensitivity to PLK1 knockdown and PLK1 drug inhibition. Finally, combined inhibition of WEE1 and PLK1 results in less apoptosis than predicted based on an additive model of the individual inhibitors, showing an epistatic interaction and confirming a prediction of the yeast data. Thus, identification of a yeast SDL interaction uncovers conserved genetic interactions that can affect human cancer cell viability.},

  abstract = {Standard CRISPR-mediated gene disruption strategies rely on Cas9-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we show that CRISPR-dependent base editing efficiently inactivates genes by precisely converting four codons (CAA, CAG, CGA, and TGG) into STOP codons without DSB formation. To facilitate gene inactivation by induction of STOP codons (iSTOP), we provide access to a database of over 3.4 million single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for iSTOP (sgSTOPs) targeting 97%-99% of genes in eight eukaryotic species, and we describe a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay that allows the rapid detection of iSTOP-mediated editing in cell populations and clones. To simplify the selection of sgSTOPs, our resource includes annotations for off-target propensity, percentage of isoforms targeted, prediction of nonsense-mediated decay, and restriction enzymes for RFLP analysis. Additionally, our database includes sgSTOPs that could be employed to precisely model over 32,000 cancer-associated nonsense mutations. Altogether, this work provides a comprehensive resource for DSB-free gene disruption by iSTOP.},

  abstract = {During homologous recombination, cells must coordinate repair, DNA damage checkpoint signaling, and movement of chromosomal loci to facilitate homology search. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, increased movement of damaged loci (local mobility) and undamaged loci (global mobility) precedes homolog pairing in mitotic cells. How cells modulate chromosome mobility in response to DNA damage remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that global chromosome mobility is regulated by the Rad51 recombinase and its mediator, Rad52. Surprisingly, rad51Δ rad52Δ cells display checkpoint-dependent constitutively increased mobility, indicating that a regulatory circuit exists between recombination and checkpoint machineries to govern chromosomal mobility. We found that the requirement for Rad51 in this circuit is distinct from its role in recombination and that interaction with Rad52 is necessary to alleviate inhibition imposed by mediator recruitment to ssDNA. Thus, interplay between recombination factors and the checkpoint restricts increased mobility until recombination proteins are assembled at damaged sites.},

  abstract = {{DNA} sequence information is constantly threatened by damage. In the clinic, intentional {DNA} damage is often used to treat cancer. Cisplatin, a first-line chemotherapy used to treat millions of patients, functions specifically by generating physical links within {DNA} strands, blocking {DNA} replication, and killing dividing cells. To maintain genome integrity, organisms have evolved the capacity to repair, respond, or otherwise resist change to the {DNA} sequence through a network of genetically encoded {DNA} damage tolerance pathways. In chapter 1, I present advances in experimental design and current progress for a systems genetics approach, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to reveal relationships between cisplatin tolerance pathways. Additionally, recent efforts to sequence thousands of cancer genomes have revealed recurrent genetic changes that cause overexpression of specific cisplatin tolerance genes. In chapter 2, I present a submitted manuscript that models overexpression of an essential cisplatin tolerance gene. This study uses a systems genetics approach to reveal the genetic pathways that are essential for tolerating this perturbation, which ultimately led to mechanistic insights for this gene. Convenient genome engineering in Saccharomyces has made this organism an ideal model to develop systems genetics concepts and approaches. In chapter 3, I present a published manuscript that demonstrates a new approach to disrupting genes by making site-specific nonsense mutations. Importantly, this approach does not require cytotoxic double-strand {DNA} breaks and is applicable to many model organisms for disrupting almost any gene, which may advance systems genetics into new model organisms. Systems genetics provides a framework for determining how {DNA} damage tolerance pathways act together to maintain cellular fitness and genome integrity. Such insights may one day help clinicians predict which cancers will respond to treatment, potentially sparing patients from unnecessary chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {The postreplication repair gene, HLTF, is often amplified and overexpressed in cancer. Here we model HLTF dysregulation through the functionally conserved Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog, RAD5. Genetic interaction profiling and landscape enrichment analysis of RAD5 overexpression (RAD5OE) reveals requirements for genes involved in recombination, crossover resolution, and DNA replication. While RAD5OE and rad5Δ both cause cisplatin sensitivity and share many genetic interactions, RAD5OE specifically requires crossover resolving genes and drives recombination in a region of repetitive DNA. Remarkably, RAD5OE induced recombination does not require other post-replication repair pathway members, or the PCNA modification sites involved in regulation of this pathway. Instead, the RAD5OE phenotype depends on a conserved domain necessary for binding 3' DNA ends. Analysis of DNA replication intermediates supports a model in which dysregulated Rad5 causes aberrant template switching at replication forks. The direct effect of Rad5 on replication forks in vivo, increased recombination, and cisplatin sensitivity predicts similar consequences for dysregulated HLTF in cancer.},

  abstract = {During S phase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, chromosomal loci become mobile in response to DNA double-strand breaks both at the break site (local mobility) and throughout the nucleus (global mobility). Increased nuclear exploration is regulated by the recombination machinery and the DNA damage checkpoint and is likely an important aspect of homology search. While mobility in response to DNA damage has been studied extensively in S phase, the response in interphase has not, and the question of whether homologous recombination proceeds to completion in G1 phase remains controversial. Here, we find that global mobility is triggered in G1 phase. As in S phase, global mobility in G1 phase is controlled by the DNA damage checkpoint and the Rad51 recombinase. Interestingly, despite the restriction of Rad52 mediator foci to S phase, Rad51 foci form at high levels in G1 phase. Together, these observations indicate that the recombination and checkpoint machineries promote global mobility in G1 phase, supporting the notion that recombination can occur in interphase diploids.},
