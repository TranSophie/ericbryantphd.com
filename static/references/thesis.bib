  abstract = {Although cellular behaviors are dynamic, the networks that govern these behaviors have been mapped primarily as static snapshots. Using an approach called differential epistasis mapping, we have discovered widespread changes in genetic interaction among yeast kinases, phosphatases, and transcription factors as the cell responds to DNA damage. Differential interactions uncover many gene functions that go undetected in static conditions. They are very effective at identifying DNA repair pathways, highlighting new damage-dependent roles for the Slt2 kinase, Pph3 phosphatase, and histone variant Htz1. The data also reveal that protein complexes are generally stable in response to perturbation, but the functional relations between these complexes are substantially reorganized. Differential networks chart a new type of genetic landscape that is invaluable for mapping cellular responses to stimuli.},

  abstract = {To protect the genome, cells have evolved a diverse set of pathways designed to sense, signal, and repair multiple types of DNA damage. To assess the degree of coordination and crosstalk among these pathways, we systematically mapped changes in the cell's genetic network across a panel of different DNA-damaging agents, resulting in ~1,800,000 differential measurements. Each agent was associated with a distinct interaction pattern, which, unlike single-mutant phenotypes or gene expression data, has high statistical power to pinpoint the specific repair mechanisms at work. The agent-specific networks revealed roles for the histone acetyltranferase Rtt109 in the mutagenic bypass of DNA lesions and the neddylation machinery in cell-cycle regulation and genome stability, while the network induced by multiple agents implicates Irc21, an uncharacterized protein, in checkpoint control and DNA repair. Our multiconditional genetic interaction map provides a unique resource that identifies agent-specific and general DNA damage response pathways.},

To find regulators of Mec1-Ddc2, we exploited a mec1 mutant that retains catalytic activity in G2 and recruitment to stalled replication forks, but which is compromised for the intra-S phase checkpoint. Two screens, one for spontaneous survivors and an E-MAP screen for synthetic growth effects, identified loss of PP4 phosphatase, pph3Δ and psy2Δ, as the strongest suppressors of mec1-100 lethality on HU. Restored Rad53 phosphorylation accounts for part, but not all, of the pph3Δ-mediated survival. Phosphoproteomic analysis confirmed that 94% of the mec1-100-compromised targets on HU are PP4 regulated, including a phosphoacceptor site within Mec1 itself, mutation of which confers damage sensitivity. Physical interaction between Pph3 and Mec1, mediated by cofactors Psy2 and Ddc2, is shown biochemically and through FRET in subnuclear repair foci. This establishes a physical and functional Mec1-PP4 unit for regulating the checkpoint response. },

We have constructed doubly mutant strains of types (I, I), (I, II), (I, III), and (II, III) and have measured their sensitivity to UV, X-rays, and MMS in order to characterize the interactions of the various mutant gene pairs. Class (I, III) double mutants proved to be supersensitive to UV and HN2 and class (II, III) double mutants proved to be supersensitive to X-rays and MMS. All other double mutants showed little or no enhancement of sensitivity over their most sensitive single mutant parents. Mutants of class I are known to be defective in excision repair and our results are consistent with the idea that there exist at least two additional pathways for dark repair in yeast, one capable of repairing X-ray and MMS damage to DNA, and another, possibly analogous to post-replication repair in bacteria, that competes with the other two for damaged regions in DNA.},

The site of reversion used was a well-defined chain initiation mutant mapping in the structural gene coding for iso-1-cytochrome c. High doses of EMS and HNO(2) resulted in decreased reversion of cyc1-131 in rad6, rad9 and rad15 strains compared to the normal RAD+ strains. In addition, rad52 greatly decreased EMS reversion of cyc1-131 but had not effect on HNO( 2)-induced reversion; rad18, on the other hand, increased HNO( 2)-induced reversion but did not alter EMS-induced reversion. When NQO was used as the mutagen, every rad gene tested, except for rad14 , had an effect on reversion; rad6, rad9, rad15, rad17, rad18, rad22, rev1, rev2 and rev3 lowered NQO reversion while rad1, rad2, rad3, rad4, rad10, rad12 and rad16 increased it compared to the RAD+ strain. The effect of rad genes on chemical mutagenesis is discussed in terms of their effect on UV mutagenesis. It is concluded that although the nature of the repair pathways may differ for UV- and chemically-induced mutations in yeast, a functional repair system is required for the induction of mutation by the chemical agents NQO, EMS and HNO(2).},

We have also shown that its effect is specific and confined to only some highly revertible ochre alleles. The REV2 gene product appears to enhance reversion at these sites by facilitating the conversion of two otherwise nonmutagenic photo-products into a single premutational lesion. UV-induced killing of rev2-1 strains was found to be significantly greater on fermentable rather than on nonfermentable media.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Physical and chemical mutagens can produce various kinds of structural defects in yeast DNA. Under appropriate vegetative growth conditions, such changes in DNA may lead to killing (measured as inhibition of macrocolony formation), mutation, or mitotic recombination. Sensitivity to these effects depends on the nature of the mutagen, on the genetic constitution of the cells, and on their physiological state before, during, and after exposure. For reviews of early work in this area see Mortimer (1961), Haynes (1964a, 1975a), James and Werner (1965), and Kilbey (1975).

  Our knowledge of the mechanisms of DNA repair and its involvement in mutagenesis has come primarily from genetic and biochemical studies on the effects of ultraviolet light (254 nm UV) on microorganisms, including yeast (Haynes et al. 1966; Hanawalt and Setlow 1975; Hanawalt et al. 1978, 1979). Therefore, in this chapter, our discussion of general concepts is based largely on experimental results from the UV photobiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, most of the ideas are applicable in broad outline, if not in precise genetic or biochemical detail, to the corresponding cellular responses to ionizing radiation and chemical mutagens. For information concerning these latter mutagens, as well as UV, see the recent articles by Kircher et al. (1979), Resnick (1979), Ruhland and Brendel (1979), Lemontt (1980), Prakash and Prakash (1980) and Lawrence (1981).

  At the observational level in large populations, the genetic effects of UV are randomly distributed, generally independent of one another, and the dose-response relations can be described formally by single-event1 Poisson...},

Both were due to single recessive nuclear genes. Mutant allele snm1-2 (ts) showed mainly ts-sensitivity to HN2, whereas mutant allele snm2-1 (ts) conferred ts-sensitivity to HN2, half mustard (HN1) and UV. In temperature-shift experiments it was determined that the functions of SNM1 and SNM2 are needed for recovery within 6 to 7 h. after mutagen exposure during incubation at 23 °C on YEPD when HN2 and UV are applied. After HN1 treatment the SNM2 coded function is required for recovery for about 14 hrs. This possibly indicates a handling of UV- and HN2-induced lesions different from that of HN1-induced lesions. },

From the observed epistatic or synergistic interactions of the combinations of mutant alleles we could derive the relation of the SNM1 and SNM2 genes to the postulated repair pathways. Alleles snm1-1 and snml-2 (ts) were found epistatic to genes of the rad3 group, whereas snm2-1 (ts) was epistatic to rad6. The snm1 and snm2 mutant alleles interacted synergistically.

  abstract = {Using the thermoconditional yeast mutant rev2ts that controls an apparently site-specific step of mutagenic DNA repair it was possible to measure the time course of REV2 dependent UV-induced reversion of the ochre allele his5-2 and recovery of survival for UV-treated stationary phase cells: due to the rev2ts coded protein being active at 23 degrees C, survival and mutation frequencies increased with duration of incubation under permissive conditions in growth medium before the temperature was shifted to 36 degrees C (restrictive temperature). This increase was abolished in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide. Furthermore, the REV2 dependent recovery of survival could be blocked or nearly blocked by cycloheximide added at any time during repair. Therefore, REV2 dependent repair can be characterized as a process requiring concomitant protein synthesis. These findings give further support to the concept that in yeast, mutagenesis involves UV inducible components of DNA repair.},

In UV-irradiated, exponentially growing rev2ts cells the REV2 dependent repair activity persists for up to 8 h at permissive temperature (23 degrees C), while the REV2 dependent mutagenic process is mostly completed within 2 h. The REV2 dependent process in exponentially growing cells is highly impaired by inhibition of protein synthesis. However, a REV2 dependent repair activity independent of de novo synthesis is detectable, even in the presence of up to 200 micrograms/ml cycloheximide, a response not found in stationary phase cells. Thus, the REV2 dependent process seems to be partially constitutive in exponentially growing cells. Additionally, exponentially growing rev2ts cells were considerably more UV-sensitive at restrictive temperature (36 degrees C) than were stationary phase cells.},

Inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide during incubation at permissive conditions blocks this REV 2 dependent recovery process in stationary phase rev 2ts cells, whereas it can be reduced but not totally abolished in exponentially growing cells. These results indicate a strict dependence on post-irradiation protein synthesis in stationary phase cells and argue for a considerable constitutive level and only limited inducibility in logarithmic phase cells. The UV inducibility of the REV 2 coded function in stationary phase cells could be confirmed by analysis of the dose-response pattern of the his 5-2 reversion: in stationary phase rev 2ts cells, the quadratic component of the biphasic linear-quadratic induction kinetics found at 23 degrees C, which is interpreted as the consequence of induction of mutagenic repair, is eliminated at 36 degrees C.},

These adducts were recently characterized although several discrepancies remained to be resolved. In these studies, [3H]-cis-dichloro(ethylenediamine)platinum(II) (cis-DEP) was used because of the convenience of the radiolabel; this analogue produces adducts at identical sites in DNA as cis-DDP. Both drugs platinate the following sequences in DNA: GG, 65%; AG, 25%; GNG, 6%. The adduct at AG sequences invariably has adenine on the 5'-terminus of the dimer. The present enzyme digestion protocol included P1 nuclease, which produced complete digestion rather than as previously reported. The frequency of platination at GG was too high to be explained by an initial monofunctional platination at any guanine. However, direct bifunctional attack preferentially at GG was obviated because monofunctional adducts could be trapped with thiourea at short time periods. After short incubations, with cis-DEP and removal of unreacted drug, the monofunctional adducts slowly rearranged to bifunctional adducts. It is suggested that this evolution of adducts may result from the drug {"}walking{"} along the double helix, a phenomenon that does not appear to occur in single-stranded DNA.},

These cell-surface molecules play a pivotal part in the recognition of antigens, the cytotoxic response of T cells, and the induction of self tolerance. It is possible, however, that the function of MHC class I molecules is not restricted to the immune system, but extends to a wide variety of biological reactions including cell-cell interactions. For example, MHC class I molecules seem to be associated with various cell-surface proteins, including the receptors for insulin, epidermal growth factor, luteinizing hormone and the beta-adrenergic receptor. In mice, class I molecules are secreted in the urine and act as highly specific olfactory cues which influence mating preference. The beta 2-m protein has also been identified as the smaller component of the Fc receptor in neonatal intestinal cells, and it has been suggested that the protein induces collagenase in fibroblasts. Cells lacking beta 2-m are deficient in the expression of MHC class I molecules, indicating that the association with beta 2-m is crucial for the transport of MHC class I molecules to the cell surface. The most direct means of unravelling the many biological functions of beta 2-m is to create a mutant mouse with a defective beta 2-m gene. We have now used the technique of homologous recombination to disrupt the beta 2-m gene. We report here that introduction of a targeting vector into embryonic stem cells resulted in beta 2-m gene disruption with high frequency. Chimaeric mice derived from blastocysts injected with mutant embryonic stem cell clones transmit the mutant allele to their offspring.},

We have examined the role of two recombination- and repair-defective mutations, rad1 and rad52, on direct repeat recombination in transcriptionally active and inactive sequences. We show that the RAD52 gene is required for transcription-stimulated recombination events leading to loss of the integrated plasmid. Similarly, Gal+ events between the duplicated repeats that retain the integrated plasmid DNA (Gal+ Ura+ replacement events) are reduced 20-fold in the rad52 mutant in sequences that are constitutively expressed. In contrast, in sequences that are not expressed, the rad52 mutation reduces plasmid loss events by only twofold and Gal+ Ura+ replacements by fourfold. We also observe an increase in disome-associated plasmid loss events in the rad52 mutant, indicative of chromosome gain. This event is not affected by expression of the region. Plasmid loss events in rad1 mutant strains are reduced only twofold in transcriptionally active sequences and are not affected in sequences that are repressed. However, the rad1 and rad52 double mutant shows a decrease in plasmid loss events greater than the sum of the decreases in the rates of this event displayed by either single mutant in both constitutive and repressed DNA, indicating a synergistic interaction between these two genes. The synergism is limited to recombination since the rad1 rad52 double mutant is no more sensitive when compared with either single mutant in its ability to survive radiation damage. Finally, the recombination pathway that remains in the double mutant is positively affected by transcription of the region.},

Examination of a hydrophobicity plot of the putative Rev2 protein predicts the existence of transmembrane helices.

To unambiguously define the function of RAD5, we have cloned the RAD5 gene, determined the effects of the rad5 deletion mutation on DNA repair, DNA damage-induced mutagenesis, and other cellular processes, and analyzed the sequence of RAD5-encoded protein. Our genetic studies indicate that RAD5 functions primarily with RAD18 in error-free postreplication repair. We also show that RAD5 affects the rate of instability of poly(GT) repeat sequences. Genomic poly(GT) sequences normally change length at a rate of about 10(-4); this rate is approximately 10-fold lower in the rad5 deletion mutant than in the corresponding isogenic wild-type strain. RAD5 encodes a protein of 1,169 amino acids of M(r) 134,000, and it contains several interesting sequence motifs. All seven conserved domains found associated with DNA helicases are present in RAD5. RAD5 also contains a cysteine-rich sequence motif that resembles the corresponding sequences found in 11 other proteins, including those encoded by the DNA repair gene RAD18 and the RAG1 gene required for immunoglobin gene arrangement. A leucine zipper motif preceded by a basic region is also present in RAD5. The cysteine-rich region may coordinate the binding of zinc; this region and the basic segment might constitute distinct DNA-binding domains in RAD5. Possible roles of RAD5 putative ATPase/DNA helicase activity in DNA repair and in the maintenance of wild-type rates of instability of simple repetitive sequences are discussed.},

  abstract = {Considerable homology has recently been noted between the proteins encoded by the RAD5, RAD16 and RAD54 genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These genes are members of the RAD6, RAD3 and RAD50 epistasis groups, respectively, which correspond to the three major DNA repair pathways in yeast. These proteins also share homology with other eucaryotic proteins, including those encoded by SNF2 and MOT1 of yeast, brahma and lodestar of Drosophila and the human ERCC6 gene. The homology shares features with known helicases, suggesting a newly identified helicase subfamily. We have constructed a series of congenic single-, double- and triple-deletion mutants involving RAD5, RAD16 and RAD54 to examine the interactions between these genes. Each deletion mutation alone has only a moderate effect on survival after exposure to UV radiation. Each pairwise-double mutant exhibits marked synergism. The triple-deletion mutant displays further synergism. These results confirm the assignment of the RAD54 gene to the RAD50 epistasis group and suggest that the RAD16 gene play a larger role in DNA repair after exposure to UV radiation than has been suggested previously. Additionally, the proteins encoded by RAD5, RAD16 and RAD54 may compete for the same substrate after damage induced by UV radiation, possibly at an early step in their respective pathways.},

This hybrid module permits efficient selection of transformants resistant against geneticin (G418). We also constructed a lacZMT reporter module in which the open reading-frame of the E. coli lacZ gene (lacking the first 9 codons) is fused at its 3' end to the S. cerevisiae ADH1 terminator. KanMX and the lacZMT module, or both modules together, were cloned in the center of a new multiple cloning sequence comprising 18 unique restriction sites flanked by Not I sites. Using the double module for constructions of in-frame substitutions of genes, only one transformation experiment is necessary to test the activity of the promotor and to search for phenotypes due to inactivation of this gene. To allow for repeated use of the G418 selection some kanMX modules are flanked by 470 bp direct repeats, promoting in vivo excision with frequencies of 10(-3)-10(-4). The 1.4 kb kanMX module was also shown to be very useful for PCR based gene disruptions. In an experiment in which a gene disruption was done with DNA molecules carrying PCR-added terminal sequences of only 35 bases homology to each target site, all twelve tested geneticin-resistant colonies carried the correctly integrated kanMX module.},

  abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

We have then used the subfamily structure to predict the functions of some of the uncharacterized proteins in the SNF2 family. We discuss possible implications of this evolutionary analysis on the general properties and evolution of the SNF2 family.},

Cloning and sequence analysis of these suppressor genes has unexpectedly shown them to code for components of the RNA polymerase II transcription complex. SOH2 is identical to RPB2, which encodes the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, and SOH4 is the same as SUA7, encoding the yeast transcription initiation factor TFIIB. SOH1 encodes a novel 14-kD protein with limited sequence similarity to RNA polymerases. Interestingly, SOH1 not only interacts with factors involved in DNA repair, but transcription as well. Thus, the Soh1 protein may serve to couple these two processes. The Soh1 protein interacts with a DNA repair protein, Rad5p, in a two-hybrid system assay. Soh1p may functionally interact with components of the RNA polymerase II complex as suggested from the synthetic lethality observed in soh1 rpb delta 104, soh1 soh2-1 (rpb2), and soh1 soh4 (sua7) double mutants. Because mutations in SOH1, RPB2 and SUA7 suppress the hyperrecombination phenotype of hpr1 mutants, this suggests a link between recombination in direct repeats and transcription.},

The site RFB (replication fork blocking) is located within one of two cis-elements present in a nontranscribed region of each repeated unit, which are required for obtaining maximal activity of a hotspot (HOT1) dependent recombination.
RESULTS: To investigate the correlation between replication fork blocking at RFB and homologous recombination at HOT1, we have isolated Hot1-defective mutants and examined their ability for fork blocking at RFB. Amongst 23 isolated mutants, four were found to be defective in both abilities. Genetic analysis of the mutants reveals that a single mutation, named fob1 (fork blocking less), is responsible for the defects in both abilities. The FOB1 gene is located on chromosome IV and has no homology with any other genes listed in DNA data banks.
CONCLUSION: The pleiotropic effect of the fob1 mutation suggests that homologous recombination at HOT1 is closely linked with DNA replication fork blocking event at RFB.},

To test the specificity of the method, two reference genes, CTF13, encoding a centromere binding protein, and ORC6, encoding a subunit of the origin of replication binding complex, were overexpressed in a large collection of mutants defective in either chromosome segregation or replication. CTF13 overexpression caused synthetic dosage lethality in combination with ctf14-42 (cbf2, ndc10), ctf17-61 (chl4), ctf19-58 and ctf19-26. ORC6 overexpression caused synthetic dosage lethality in combination with cdc2-1, cdc6-1, cdc14-1, cdc16-1 and cdc46-1. These relationships reflect specific interactions, as overexpression of CTF13 caused lethality in kinetochore mutants and overexpression of ORC6 caused lethality in replication mutants. In contrast, only one case of dosage suppression was observed. We suggest that synthetic dosage lethality identifies a broad spectrum of interacting mutations and is of general utility in detecting specific genetic interactions using a cloned wild-type gene as a starting point. Furthermore, synthetic dosage lethality is easily adapted to the study of cloned genes in other organisms.},

Here we report the characterization of the Zbu1 gene, also known as HIP116, located on human chromosome band 3q25, which encodes a DNA-binding member of this superfamily. Zbu1 was isolated in this study by its affinity for a site in the myosin light chain 1/3 enhancer. The protein has single-stranded DNA-dependent ATPase activity, includes seven helicase motifs, and a RING finger motif that is shared exclusively by the RAD5, spRAD8, and RAD16 family members. During mouse embryogenesis, Zbu1 transcripts are detected relatively late in fetal development and increase in neonatal stages, whereas the protein accumulates asynchronously in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. In adult human tissues, alternatively spliced Zbu1 transcripts are ubiquitous with highest expression in these tissues. Gene expression is also dramatically induced in human tumor lines and in Li-Fraumeni fibroblast cultures, suggesting that it is aberrantly regulated in malignant cells. The developmental profile of Zbu1 gene expression and the association of the protein with a tissue-specific transcriptional regulatory element distinguish it from other members of the SWI2/SNF2 family and suggest novel roles for the Zbu1 gene product.},

Similarly, it may be possible to identify and validate new targets for drugs that would selectively kill tumor cells with a particular molecular context.

Their essential role in growth can be bypassed by deletion of a novel gene, SML1, which functions after several genes whose overexpression also suppresses mec1 inviability. In addition, sml1 affects various cellular processes analogous to overproducing the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, RNR1. These include effects on mitochondrial biogenesis, on the DNA damage response, and on cell growth. Consistent with these observations, the levels of dNTP pools in sml1 delta strains are increased compared to wild-type. This effect is not due to an increase in RNR transcription. Finally, both in vivo and in vitro experiments show that Sml1 binds to Rnr1. We propose that Sml1 inhibits dNTP synthesis posttranslationally by binding directly to Rnr1 and that Mec1 and Rad53 are required to relieve this inhibition.},

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the CAC1, CAC2, and CAC3 genes encode the three CAF-I subunits. Deletion of any of the three CAC genes reduces telomeric gene silencing and confers an increase in sensitivity to killing by ultraviolet (UV) radiation. We used double and triple mutants involving cac1Delta and yeast repair gene mutations to show that deletion of the CAC1 gene increases the UV sensitivity of cells mutant in genes from each of the known DNA repair epistasis groups. For example, double mutants involving cac1Delta and excision repair gene deletions rad1Delta or rad14Delta showed increased UV sensitivity, as did double mutants involving cac1Delta and deletions of members of the RAD51 recombinational repair group. cac1Delta also increased the UV sensitivity of strains with defects in either the error-prone (rev3Delta) or error-free (pol30-46) branches of RAD6-mediated postreplicative DNA repair but did not substantially increase the sensitivity of strains carrying null mutations in the RAD6 or RAD18 genes. Deletion of CAC1 also increased the UV sensitivity and rate of UV-induced mutagenesis in rad5Delta mutants, as has been observed for mutants defective in error-free postreplicative repair. Together, these data suggest that CAF-I has a role in error-free postreplicative damage repair and may also have an auxiliary role in other repair mechanisms. Like the CAC genes, RAD6 is also required for gene silencing at telomeres. We find an increased loss of telomeric gene silencing in rad6Delta cac1Delta and rad18Delta cac1Delta double mutants, suggesting that CAF-I and multiple factors in the postreplicative repair pathway influence chromosome structure.},

Perhaps the most widely useful of these are the heterologous dominant drug resistance cassettes, which use antibiotic resistance genes from bacteria and fungi as selectable markers. We have created three new dominant drug resistance cassettes by replacing the kanamycin resistance (kan(r)) open reading frame from the kanMX3 and kanMX4 disruption-deletion cassettes (Wach et al., 1994) with open reading frames conferring resistance to the antibiotics hygromycin B (hph), nourseothricin (nat) and bialaphos (pat). The new cassettes, pAG25 (natMX4), pAG29 (patMX4), pAG31 (patMX3), pAG32 (hphMX4), pAG34 (hphMX3) and pAG35 (natMX3), are cloned into pFA6, and so are in all other respects identical to pFA6-kanMX3 and pFA6-kanMX4. Most tools and techniques used with the kanMX plasmids can also be used with the hph, nat and patMX containing plasmids. These new heterologous dominant drug resistance cassettes have unique antibiotic resistance phenotypes and do not affect growth when inserted into the ho locus. These attributes make the cassettes ideally suited for creating S. cerevisiae strains with multiple mutations within a single strain.},

The production of rDNA circles depends upon intrachromosomal recombination within the rDNA tandem array, a process regulated by the protein Sir2 (Sir2p). Together with Sir1p, Sir3p, Sir4p and Orc1p, Sir2p is also involved in transcriptional silencing of genes at the silent mating-type cassettes, in the rDNA array, and at telomeres. Using a 'triple silencer' strain that can monitor an increase or decrease in gene expression at these three loci, we found that deletion of the ZDS1 gene caused an increase in silencing in the rDNA and at a silent mating-type cassette at the expense of telomere silencing. The zds1 deletion also resulted in an increase in life span and a decrease in Sir3p phosphorylation. In contrast, deletion of its paralog ZDS2 caused a decrease in rDNA silencing, a decrease in life span and an increase in Sir3p phosphorylation. As Zds2p, but not Zds1p, had strong two-hybrid interactions with Orc1p and the four Sir proteins, Zds1p might indirectly control Sir3p through a Sir3p kinase.},

  abstract = {Most cytotoxic anticancer agents damage DNA directly, interfere with DNA metabolism or chromosome segregation, and are particularly toxic in dividing cells. Although a considerable amount of information on the mechanisms of action of these agents is available, the molecular bases for selective tumor cell killing by chemotherapy are largely unknown. Many genetic alterations found in sporadic and hereditary cancers affect functions in DNA repair and cell cycle control and result in sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. We have therefore set out to determine the effects of these cancer mutations on sensitivity or resistance to various chemotherapeutic agents. Because most of the affected genes are well conserved among eukaryotes, we have carried out a comprehensive analysis of a panel of isogenic yeast strains, each defective in a particular DNA repair or cell cycle checkpoint function, for sensitivity to the Food and Drug Administration-approved cytotoxic anticancer agents. Widely different toxicity profiles were observed for 23 agents and X-rays, indicating that the type of DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoint mutations in individual tumors could strongly influence the outcome of a particular chemotherapeutic regimen.},

  abstract = {Two ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, RAD6 and the heteromeric UBC13-MMS2 complex, have been implicated in post-replicative DNA damage repair in yeast. Here we provide a mechanistic basis for cooperation between the two enzymes. We show that two chromatin-associated RING finger proteins, RAD18 and RAD5, play a central role in mediating physical contacts between the members of the RAD6 pathway. RAD5 recruits the UBC13-MMS2 complex to DNA by means of its RING finger domain. Moreover, RAD5 association with RAD18 brings UBC13-MMS2 into contact with the RAD6-RAD18 complex. Interaction between the two RING finger proteins thus promotes the formation of a heteromeric complex in which the two distinct ubiquitin-conjugating activities of RAD6 and UBC13-MMS2 can be closely coordinated. Surprisingly, UBC13 and MMS2 are largely cytosolic proteins, but DNA damage triggers their redistribution to the nucleus. These findings suggest a mechanism by which the activity of this DNA repair pathway could be regulated.},

  abstract = {The RAD6 postreplication repair and mutagenesis pathway is the only major radiation repair pathway yet to be extensively characterized. It has been previously speculated that the RAD6 pathway consists of two parallel subpathways, one error free and another error prone (mutagenic). Here we show that the RAD6 group genes can be exclusively divided into three rather than two independent subpathways represented by the RAD5, POL30, and REV3 genes; the REV3 pathway is largely mutagenic, whereas the RAD5 and the POL30 pathways are deemed error free. Mutants carrying characteristic mutations in each of the three subpathways are phenotypically indistinguishable from a single mutant such as rad18, which is defective in the entire RAD6 postreplication repair/tolerance pathway. Furthermore, the rad18 mutation is epistatic to all single or combined mutations in any of the above three subpathways. Our data also suggest that MMS2 and UBC13 play a key role in coordinating the response of the error-free subpathways; Mms2 and Ubc13 form a complex required for a novel polyubiquitin chain assembly, which probably serves as a signal transducer to promote both RAD5 and POL30 error-free postreplication repair pathways. The model established by this study will facilitate further research into the molecular mechanisms of postreplication repair and translesion DNA synthesis. In view of the high degree of sequence conservation of the RAD6 pathway genes among all eukaryotes, the model presented in this study may also apply to mammalian cells and predicts links to human diseases.},

Here, we show that Pif1p acts by inhibiting telomerase rather than telomere-telomere recombination, and this inhibition requires the helicase activity of Pif1p. Overexpression of enzymatically active Pif1p causes telomere shortening. Thus, Pif1p is a catalytic inhibitor of telomerase-mediated telomere lengthening. Because Pif1p is associated with telomeric DNA in vivo, its effects on telomeres are likely direct. Pif1p-like helicases are found in diverse organisms, including humans. We propose that Pif1p-mediated inhibition of telomerase promotes genetic stability by suppressing telomerase-mediated healing of double-strand breaks.},

We have investigated the genetic interactions between mutations in these genes with respect to cell survival and ectopic gene conversion following treatment of logarithmic and early stationary cells with UV- and gamma-rays. We find that the genetic interaction between the rad5 and rad18 mutations depends on DNA damage type and position in the cell cycle at the time of treatment. Inactivation of SRS2 suppresses damage sensitivity both in rad5 and rad18 mutants, but only when treated in logarithmic phase. When irradiated in stationary phase, the srs2 mutation enhances the sensitivity of rad5 mutants, whereas it has no effect on rad18 mutants. Irrespective of the growth phase, the srs2 mutation reduces the frequency of damage-induced ectopic gene conversion in rad5 and rad18 mutants. In addition, we find that srs2 mutants exhibit reduced spontaneous and UV-induced sister chromatid recombination (SCR), whereas rad5 and rad18 mutants are proficient for SCR. We propose a model in which the Srs2 protein has pro-recombinogenic or anti-recombinogenic activity, depending on the context of the DNA damage.},

To elucidate the contribution of RAD6 to starvation-associated mutagenesis, which occurs in nongrowing cells cultivated under selective conditions, we analyzed the phenotype of strains expressing various alleles of the RAD6 gene and single and multiple mutants of the RAD6, RAD5, RAD18, REV3, and MMS2 genes from the RAD6 repair group. Our results show that the RAD6 repair pathway is also active in starving cells and its contribution to starvation-associated mutagenesis is similar to that of spontaneous mutagenesis. Epistatic analysis based on both spontaneous and starvation-associated mutagenesis and UV sensitivity showed that the RAD6 repair group consists of distinct repair pathways of different relative importance requiring, besides the presence of Rad6, also either Rad18 or Rad5 or both. We postulate the existence of four pathways: (1) nonmutagenic Rad5/Rad6/Rad18, (2) mutagenic Rad5/Rad6 /Rev3, (3) mutagenic Rad6/Rad18/Rev3, and (4) Rad6/Rad18/Rad30. Furthermore, we show that the high mutation rate observed in rad6 mutants is caused by a mutator different from Rev3. From our data and data previously published, we suggest a role for Rad6 in DNA repair and mutagenesis and propose a model for the RAD6 postreplicative repair group.},

Inviable double-mutant meiotic progeny identify functional relationships between genes. SGA analysis of genes with roles in cytoskeletal organization (BNI1, ARP2, ARC40, BIM1), DNA synthesis and repair (SGS1, RAD27), or uncharacterized functions (BBC1, NBP2) generated a network of 291 interactions among 204 genes.

Genetic analyses led to a proposal that Srs2 acts to prevent the channeling of DNA replication-blocking lesions into homologous recombination. The phenotypes associated with srs2 indicate that the Srs2 protein acts to process lesions through RAD6-mediated post-replication repair (PRR) rather than recombination repair. The RAD6 pathway has been divided into three rather independent subpathways: two error-free (represented by RAD5 and POL30) and one error-prone (represented by REV3). In order to determine on which subpathways Srs2 acts, we performed comprehensive epistasis analyses; the experimental results indicate that the srs2 mutation completely suppresses both error-free PRR branches. Combined with UV-induced mutagenesis assays, we conclude that the Polzeta-mediated error-prone pathway is functional in the absence of Srs2; hence, Srs2 is not required for mutagenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the helicase activity of Srs2 is probably required for the phenotypic suppression of error-free PRR defects. Taken together, our observations link error-free PRR to homologous recombination through the helicase activity of Srs2.},

The mgs1 mutant is not sensitive to DNA-damaging agents, but the mgs1 rad5 double mutant has increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea and a greatly increased spontaneous mutation rate. Growth defects of mgs1 rad18 double mutants are suppressed by a mutation in SRS2, encoding a DNA helicase, or by overexpression of Rad52. More over, mgs1 mutation suppresses the temperature sensitivity of mutants in POL3, encoding DNA polymerase delta. mgs1 also suppresses the growth defect of a pol3 mutant caused by expression of Escherichia coli RuvC, a bacterial Holliday junction resolvase.

In contrast, the msh2Delta pol32Delta double mutant exhibits a synergistic mutator phenotype. Can(r) mutation spectrum analysis of pol32Delta strains revealed a substantial increase in the frequency of deletions and duplications (primarily deletions) of sequences flanked by short direct repeats, which appears to be RAD52 and RAD10 independent. To better understand the pol32Delta and rev3Delta antimutator effects in rad backgrounds and the pol32Delta mutator effect in a msh2Delta background, we determined Can(r) mutation spectra for rad5Delta, rad5Delta pol32Delta, rad5Delta rev3Delta, msh2Delta, msh2Delta pol32Delta, and msh2Delta rev3Delta strains. Both rad5Delta pol32Delta and rad5Delta rev3Delta mutants exhibit a reduction in frameshifts and base substitutions, attributable to antimutator effects conferred by the pol32Delta and rev3Delta mutations. In contrast, an increase in these two types of alterations is attributable to a synergistic mutator effect between the pol32Delta and msh2Delta mutations.

In further studies of primary colon cancer tissues, HLTF methylation was detected in 27 of 63 cases (43%). No methylation of HLTF was detected in breast or lung cancers, suggesting selection for HLTF methylation in colonic malignancies. Transfection of HLTF suppressed 75% of colony growth in each of three different HLTF-deficient cell lines, but showed no suppressive effect in any of three HLTF-proficient cell lines. These findings show that HLTF is a common target for methylation and epigenetic gene silencing in colon cancer and suggest HLTF is a candidate colon cancer suppressor gene.},

We have used this system to test the hypothesis that genes whose transcription is increased after DNA damage are important for the survival to that damage. We used a pool of 4,627 diploid strains each with homozygous deletion of a nonessential gene to identify those genes that are important for the survival of yeast to four DNA-damaging agents: ionizing radiation, UV radiation, and exposure to cisplatin or to hydrogen peroxide. In addition we measured the transcriptional response of the wild-type parental strain to the same DNA-damaging agents. We found no relationship between the genes necessary for survival to the DNA-damaging agents and those genes whose transcription is increased after exposure. These data show that few, if any, of the genes involved in repairing the DNA lesions produced in this study, including double-strand breaks, pyrimidine dimers, single-strand breaks, base damage, and DNA cross-links, are induced in response to toxic doses of the agents that produce these lesions. This finding suggests that the enzymes necessary for the repair of these lesions are at sufficient levels within the cell. The data also suggest that the nature of the lesions produced by DNA-damaging agents cannot easily be deduced from gene expression profiling.},

  abstract = {The yeast Dun1 kinase has complex checkpoint functions including DNA damage-dependent cell cycle arrest in G(2)/M, transcriptional induction of repair genes, and regulation of postreplicative DNA repair pathways. Here we report that the Dun1 forkhead-associated domain interacts with the Pan3 subunit of the poly(A)-nuclease complex and that dun1pan2 and dun1pan3 double mutants are dramatically hypersensitive to replicational stress. This phenotype was independent of the function of Dun1 in regulating deoxyribonucleotide levels as it was also observed in strains lacking the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor Sml1. dun1pan2 mutants initially arrested normally in response to replication blocks but died in the presence of persistent replication blocks with considerably delayed kinetics compared with mutants lacking the Rad53 kinase, indicating that the double mutation does not compromise the intra-S phase checkpoint. Interestingly, the RAD5 gene involved in error-free postreplication repair pathways was specifically up-regulated in dun1pan2 double mutants. Moreover, inducible overexpression of RAD5 mimicked the double mutant phenotype by hypersensitizing dun1 mutants to replication blocks. The data indicate that Dun1 and Pan2-Pan3 cooperate to regulate the stoichiometry and thereby the activity of postreplication repair complexes, suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms complement the transcriptional response in the regulation of gene expression by checkpoint signaling pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.},

Conventional genetic screens exhibit biases, and genes contributing to a phenotype are often missed. We systematically constructed a nearly complete collection of gene-deletion mutants (96% of annotated open reading frames, or ORFs) of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. DNA sequences dubbed 'molecular bar codes' uniquely identify each strain, enabling their growth to be analysed in parallel and the fitness contribution of each gene to be quantitatively assessed by hybridization to high-density oligonucleotide arrays. We show that previously known and new genes are necessary for optimal growth under six well-studied conditions: high salt, sorbitol, galactose, pH 8, minimal medium and nystatin treatment. Less than 7% of genes that exhibit a significant increase in messenger RNA expression are also required for optimal growth in four of the tested conditions. Our results validate the yeast gene-deletion collection as a valuable resource for functional genomics.},

  abstract = {The RAD6 pathway is central to post-replicative DNA repair in eukaryotic cells; however, the machinery and its regulation remain poorly understood. Two principal elements of this pathway are the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes RAD6 and the MMS2-UBC13 heterodimer, which are recruited to chromatin by the RING-finger proteins RAD18 and RAD5, respectively. Here we show that UBC9, a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-conjugating enzyme, is also affiliated with this pathway and that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) -- a DNA-polymerase sliding clamp involved in DNA synthesis and repair -- is a substrate. PCNA is mono-ubiquitinated through RAD6 and RAD18, modified by lysine-63-linked multi-ubiquitination--which additionally requires MMS2, UBC13 and RAD5--and is conjugated to SUMO by UBC9. All three modifications affect the same lysine residue of PCNA, suggesting that they label PCNA for alternative functions. We demonstrate that these modifications differentially affect resistance to DNA damage, and that damage-induced PCNA ubiquitination is elementary for DNA repair and occurs at the same conserved residue in yeast and humans.},

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the RAD6 epistasis group defines a more poorly characterized set of DNA damage response pathways, believed to be distinct from NER. Here we show that the elimination of the DNA minor groove adducts formed by an important class of anticancer antibiotic (CC-1065 family) requires NER factors in S. cerevisiae. We also demonstrate that the elimination of this class of minor groove adduct from the active MFA2 gene depends upon functional Rad18 and Rad6. This is most clear for the repair of adducts on the transcribed strand, where an absolute requirement for Rad6 and Rad18 was seen. Further experiments revealed that a specific RAD6-RAD18-controlled subpathway, the RAD5 branch, mediates these events. Cells disrupted for rad5 are highly sensitive to this minor groove binding agent, and rad5 cells exhibit an in vivo adduct elimination defect indistinguishable from that seen in rad6 and rad18 cells as well as in NER-defective cells. Our results indicate that the RAD5 subpathway may interact with NER factors during the repair of certain DNA adducts.},

In this study, we examined Mre11 complex localization and chromatin association in synchronous cultures to examine the molecular determinants of relocalization. The data indicate that the complex is deposited on chromatin in an S phase-specific manner. Mre11 complex chromatin association in S phase was resistant to detergent extraction, in contrast to that in gamma-irradiated cells. The complex exhibits extensive colocalization with proliferating cell nuclear antigen throughout S phase, and chromatin loading is enhanced by replication fork stalling, suggesting that the replication fork is a site of Mre11 complex chromatin loading. This is supported by the observation that the complex localized to single-stranded DNA arising in hydroxyurea-treated cells. Although the Mre11 complex appears to function as a DNA damage sensor, limited colocalization with Brca1 or gamma-H2AX was observed, arguing that neither DNA damage nor gamma-H2AX is required for Mre11 complex chromatin loading. These data provide a potential molecular basis for promotion of sister chromatid association and recombination by the Mre11 complex as well as for ATM-Mre11 complex-dependent activation of cell cycle checkpoints.},

Previous observations implied that the function of UBC13 and MMS2 is dependent on the presence of RAD5, suggesting that the RING finger protein might act as a ubiquitin-protein ligase specific for the UBC13-MMS2 complex. In support of this notion it is shown here that the contact surfaces between the RAD5 RING domain and UBC13 correspond to those found in other pairs of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and ubiquitin-protein ligases. Mutations that compromise the protein-protein interactions either between the RING domain and UBC13 or within the UBC13-MMS2 dimer were found to have variable effects on repair activity in vivo that strongly depended on the expression levels of the corresponding mutants. Quantitative analysis of the affinity and kinetics of the UBC13-MMS2 interaction suggests a highly dynamic association model in which compromised mutual interactions result in phenotypic effects only under conditions where protein levels become limiting. Finally, this study demonstrates that beyond its cooperation with the UBC13-MMS2 dimer, RAD5 must have an additional role in DNA damage repair independent of its RING finger domain.},

  abstract = {Cisplatin is one of the most potent antitumor agents known, displaying clinical activity against a wide variety of solid tumors. Its cytotoxic mode of action is mediated by its interaction with DNA to form DNA adducts, primarily intrastrand crosslink adducts, which activate several signal transduction pathways, including those involving ATR, p53, p73, and MAPK, and culminate in the activation of apoptosis. DNA damage-mediated apoptotic signals, however, can be attenuated, and the resistance that ensues is a major limitation of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The mechanisms responsible for cisplatin resistance are several, and contribute to the multifactorial nature of the problem. Resistance mechanisms that limit the extent of DNA damage include reduced drug uptake, increased drug inactivation, and increased DNA adduct repair. Origins of these pharmacologic-based mechanisms, however, are at the molecular level. Mechanisms that inhibit propagation of the DNA damage signal to the apoptotic machinery include loss of damage recognition, overexpression of HER-2/neu, activation of the PI3-K/Akt (also known as PI3-K/PKB) pathway, loss of p53 function, overexpression of antiapoptotic bcl-2, and interference in caspase activation. The molecular signature defining the resistant phenotype varies between tumors, and the number of resistance mechanisms activated in response to selection pressures dictates the overall extent of cisplatin resistance.},

It stabilizes stalled forks and arrests division, thereby preserving genome integrity and promoting cell survival. In budding yeast, Tof1 is thought to act as a specific mediator of the replication checkpoint signal that activates the effector kinase Rad53. Here we report studies of fission yeast Swi1, a Tof1-related protein required for a programmed fork-pausing event necessary for mating type switching. Our studies have shown that Swi1 is vital for proficient activation of the Rad53-like checkpoint kinase Cds1. Together they are required to prevent fork collapse in the ribosomal DNA repeats, and they also prevent irreversible fork arrest at a newly identified hydroxyurea pause site. Swi1 also has Cds1-independent functions. Rad22 DNA repair foci form during S phase in swi1 mutants and to a lesser extent in cds1 mutants, indicative of fork collapse. Mus81, a DNA endonuclease required for recovery from collapsed forks, is vital in swi1 but not cds1 mutants. Swi1 is recruited to chromatin during S phase. We propose that Swi1 stabilizes replication forks in a configuration that is recognized by replication checkpoint sensors.},

Formation of a chromosome fragment by de novo telomere generation at one end of the linear vector and recombination-dependent replication of 100 kb of chromosomal sequences at the other end of the vector occurred at high frequency in wild-type strains. RAD51 was required for more than 95% of BIR events involving a single-end invasion and was essential when two BIR events were required for generation of a chromosome fragment. The similar genetic requirements for BIR and gene conversion suggest a common strand invasion intermediate in these two recombinational repair processes. Mutation of RAD50 or RAD59 conferred no significant defect in BIR in either RAD51 or rad51 strains. RAD52 was shown to be essential for BIR at unique chromosomal sequences, although rare recombination events were detected between the subtelomeric Y' repeats.},

  abstract = {The MPH1 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, encoding a member of the DEAH family of proteins, had been identified by virtue of the spontaneous mutator phenotype of respective deletion mutants. Genetic analysis suggested that MPH1 functions in a previously uncharacterized DNA repair pathway that protects the cells from damage-induced mutations. We have now analyzed genetic interactions of mph1 with a variety of mutants from different repair systems with respect to spontaneous mutation rates and sensitivities to different DNA-damaging agents. The dependence of the mph1 mutator phenotype on REV3 and REV1 and the synergy with mutations in base and nucleotide excision repair suggest an involvement of MPH1 in error-free bypass of lesions. However, although we observed an unexpected partial suppression of the mph1 mutator phenotype by rad5, genetic interactions with other mutations in postreplicative repair imply that MPH1 does not belong to this pathway. Instead, mutations from the homologous recombination pathway were found to be epistatic to mph1 with respect to both spontaneous mutation rates and damage sensitivities. Determination of spontaneous mitotic recombination rates demonstrated that mph1 mutants are not deficient in homologous recombination. On the contrary, in an sgs1 background we found a pronounced hyperrecombination phenotype. Thus, we propose that MPH1 is involved in a branch of homologous recombination that is specifically dedicated to error-free bypass.},

Here we report our studies with a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) mutation, pol30-119, which results from a change of the lysine 164 residue to arginine. It has been shown recently that following treatment of yeast cells with DNA-damaging agents, the lysine 164 residue of PCNA becomes monoubiquitinated in a Rad6-Rad18-dependent manner and that subsequently this PCNA residue is polyubiquitinated via a lysine 63-linked ubiquitin chain in an Mms2-Ubc13-, Rad5-dependent manner. PCNA is also modified by SUMO conjugation at the lysine 164 residue. Our genetic studies with the pol30-119 mutation show that in addition to conferring a defect in Polzeta-dependent UV mutagenesis and in Poleta-dependent TLS, this PCNA mutation inhibits postreplicational repair of discontinuities that form in the newly synthesized strand across from UV lesions. In addition, we provide evidence for the activation of the RAD52 recombinational pathway in the pol30-119 mutant and we infer that SUMO conjugation at the lysine 164 residue of PCNA has a role in suppressing the Rad52-dependent postreplicational repair pathway.},

To experimentally expand our knowledge of other pathway(s) that suppress GCRs, we developed a generally applicable genome-wide screening method. In this screen, we identified 10 genes (ALO1, CDC50, CSM2, ELG1, ESC1, MMS4, RAD5, RAD18, TSA1, and UFO1) that encode proteins functioning in the suppression of GCRs. Moreover, the breakpoint junctions of GCRs from these GCR mutator mutants were determined with modified breakpoint-mapping methods. We also identified nine genes (AKR1, BFR1, HTZ1, IES6, NPL6, RPL13B, RPL27A, RPL35A, and SHU2) whose mutations generated growth defects with the pif1Delta mutation. In addition, we found that some of these mutations changed the telomere size.},

  abstract = {Cisplatin is a crucial agent in the treatment of many solid tumors, yet many tumors have either acquired or intrinsic resistance to the drug. We have used the homozygous diploid deletion pool of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, containing 4728 strains with individual deletion of all nonessential genes, to systematically identify genes that when deleted confer sensitivity to the anticancer agents cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and mitomycin C. We found that deletions of genes involved in nucleotide excision repair, recombinational repair, postreplication repair including translesional synthesis, and DNA interstrand cross-link repair resulted in sensitivity to all three of the agents, although with some differences between the platinum drugs and mitomycin C in the spectrum of required translesional polymerases. Putative defective repair of oxidative damage (imp2'Delta strain) also resulted in sensitivity to platinum and oxaliplatin, but not to mitomycin C. Surprisingly in light of their different profiles of clinical activity, cisplatin and oxaliplatin have very similar sensitivity profiles. Finally, we identified three novel genes (PSY1-3, {"}platinum sensitivity{"}) that, when deleted, demonstrate sensitivity to cisplatin and oxaliplatin, but not to mitomycin C. Our results emphasize the importance of multiple DNA repair pathways responsible for normal cellular resistance to all three of the agents. Also, the similarity of the sensitivity profiles of the platinum agents with that of the known DNA interstrand cross-linking agent mitomycin C, and the importance of the gene PSO2 known to be involved in DNA interstrand cross-link repair strongly suggests that interstrand cross-links are important toxic lesions for cisplatin and oxaliplatin, at least in yeast.},

PCNA, a processivity factor with essential functions in replication and repair, is modified with ubiquitin at K164. In addition, PCNA is sumoylated at K127 and K164. We found that the rad18delta mutation suppresses the temperature sensitivity of the polymerase delta mutants hys2-1 and cdc2-1 as well as the synthetic lethality of cdc2-1 pol32delta mutants, suggesting a role for Rad18 in modulating DNA replication. As Rad18 mediates ubiquitination of PCNA, we examined whether PCNA modifications affected its function in replication. Multicopy PCNA alleviated the replication defects of rfc5-1 strains, but not those of poldelta mutants. In contrast, multicopy PCNA-K164R had reduced ability to suppress the replication defects of rfc5-1, but alleviated those of poldelta mutants. The roles of sumoylated and ubiquitinated PCNA in rfc5-1 and hys2-1 mutants were addressed by using mutant backgrounds that selectively affected sumoylation (siz1delta), ubiquitination (rad18delta), polyubiquitination (rad5delta, mms2delta), or the ability of cells to perform translesion synthesis (polzetadelta, poletadelta). Our results are consistent with the idea that the Rad18/Rad5/Mms2 polyubiquitination pathway is important for replication completion, perhaps by promoting a template switch type of DNA synthesis.},

Up to now, about 35 platinum complexes entered clinical trials in order to circumvent the side-effects and the problem of tumor resistance to cisplatin. Additionally, improvement of tumor selectivity as well as the need for a broader spectrum of indications are the motivations for tremendous efforts in the development of novel anticancer platinum-based drugs. New synthetic strategies and innovative analytical approaches provide a basis for a deeper understanding of the pharmacological profile of cisplatin and analogues (biodistribution, clearance, detoxification, side-effects, tumor specificity, cellular uptake, acquired or intrinsic resistance, platinum-DNA adduct removal by the cellular machinery) and give rise to a rational design of promising anticancer platinum coordination compounds. This article reviews the recent development of preclinical platinum complexes with interesting in vitro and in vivo tumor inhibiting properties. It focuses also on innovative synthetic strategies leading to novel classes of platinum complexes. A small part of the review is dedicated to new analytical approaches which have been supplied to or emerged in this field of research.},

We searched for factors involved in the processing of stalled forks in HU-treated rad53 cells. Using the neutral-neutral two-dimensional electrophoresis technique (2D gel) and psoralen crosslinking combined with electron microscopy (EM), we found that the Exo1 exonuclease is recruited to stalled forks and, in rad53 mutants, counteracts reversed fork accumulation by generating ss-DNA intermediates. Hence, Exo1-mediated fork processing resembles the action of E. coli RecJ nuclease at damaged forks. Fork stability and replication restart are influenced by both DNA polymerase-fork association and Exo1-mediated processing. We suggest that Exo1 counteracts fork reversal by resecting newly synthesized chains and resolving the sister chromatid junctions that cause regression of collapsed forks.},

Having just completed his education as a physician, Miescher moved to Tübingen to work in the laboratory of biochemist Hoppe-Seyler, his aim being to elucidate the building blocks of life. Choosing leucocytes as his source material, he first investigated the proteins in these cells. However, during these experiments, he noticed a substance with unexpected properties that did not match those of proteins. Miescher had obtained the first crude purification of DNA. He further examined the properties and composition of this enigmatic substance and showed that it fundamentally differed from proteins. Due to its occurrence in the cells' nuclei, he termed the novel substance {"}nuclein{"}--a term still preserved in today's name deoxyribonucleic acid.},

RecQ helicases, including yeast Sgs1 and human BLM, have been implicated in both replication and recombination and protect genome integrity by preventing unscheduled mitotic recombination events. We have studied the RecQ helicase-mediated mechanisms controlling genome stability by analyzing replication forks encountering a damaged template in sgs1 cells. We show that, in sgs1 mutants, recombination-dependent cruciform structures accumulate at damaged forks. Their accumulation requires Rad51 protein, is counteracted by Srs2 DNA helicase, and does not prevent fork movement. Sgs1, but not Srs2, promotes resolution of these recombination intermediates. A functional Rad53 checkpoint kinase that is known to protect the integrity of the sister chromatid junctions is required for the accumulation of recombination intermediates in sgs1 mutants. Finally, top3 and top3 sgs1 mutants accumulate the same structures as sgs1 cells. We suggest that, in sgs1 cells, the unscheduled accumulation of Rad51-dependent cruciform structures at damaged forks result from defective maturation of recombination-dependent intermediates that originate from the replication-related sister chromatid junctions. Our findings might contribute to explaining some of the recombination defects of BLM cells.},

We have found reproducibly 22 genes/open reading frames (ORF), which when deleted, confer resistance to cisplatin at a concentration that is lethal to wild-type cells. Complementation of individual deletion strains with the corresponding wild-type gene abolished cisplatin resistance, confirming that specific gene deletions caused the resistance. Twenty of the genes/ORFs identified have not been previously linked to cisplatin resistance and belong to several distinct functional groups. Major functional groups encode proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism, mRNA catabolism, RNA-polymerase-II-dependent gene regulation and vacuolar transport systems. In addition, proteins that function in ubiquitination, sphingolipid biogenesis, cyclic AMP-dependent signaling, DNA repair, and genome stability are also associated with cisplatin resistance. More than half of the identified genes are known to have sequences or functional homology to mammalian counterparts. Some deletion strains are cross-resistant to selected cytotoxic agents whereas hypersensitive to others. The sensitivity of certain resistant strains to other cytotoxic agents suggests that our findings may point to particular drug combinations that can overcome resistance caused by inactivation of specific genes.},

Upon DNA damage, PCNA is modified at the conserved lysine residue 164 by either mono-ubiquitin or a lysine-63-linked multi-ubiquitin chain, which induce error-prone or error-free replication bypasses of the lesions. In S phase, even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, yeast PCNA can be alternatively modified by the small ubiquitin-related modifier protein SUMO; however the consequences of this remain controversial. Here we show by genetic analysis that SUMO-modified PCNA functionally cooperates with Srs2, a helicase that blocks recombinational repair by disrupting Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments. Moreover, Srs2 displays a preference for interacting directly with the SUMO-modified form of PCNA, owing to a specific binding site in its carboxy-terminal tail. Our finding suggests a model in which SUMO-modified PCNA recruits Srs2 in S phase in order to prevent unwanted recombination events of replicating chromosomes.},

  abstract = {The mechanistic and therapeutic differences in the cellular response to DNA-damaging compounds are not completely understood, despite intense study. To expand our knowledge of DNA damage, we assayed the effects of 12 closely related DNA-damaging agents on the complete pool of approximately 4,700 barcoded homozygous deletion strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In our protocol, deletion strains are pooled together and grown competitively in the presence of compound. Relative strain sensitivity is determined by hybridization of PCR-amplified barcodes to an oligonucleotide array carrying the barcode complements. These screens identified genes in well-characterized DNA-damage-response pathways as well as genes whose role in the DNA-damage response had not been previously established. High-throughput individual growth analysis was used to independently confirm microarray results. Each compound produced a unique genome-wide profile. Analysis of these data allowed us to determine the relative importance of DNA-repair modules for resistance to each of the 12 profiled compounds. Clustering the data for 12 distinct compounds uncovered both known and novel functional interactions that comprise the DNA-damage response and allowed us to define the genetic determinants required for repair of interstrand cross-links. Further genetic analysis allowed determination of epistasis for one of these functional groups.},

Crucial to the interpretation of E-MAPs is their high-density nature made possible by focusing on logically connected gene subsets and including essential genes. Described here is the analysis of an E-MAP of genes acting in the yeast early secretory pathway. Hierarchical clustering, together with novel analytical strategies and experimental verification, revealed or clarified the role of many proteins involved in extensively studied processes such as sphingolipid metabolism and retention of HDEL proteins. At a broader level, analysis of the E-MAP delineated pathway organization and components of physical complexes and illustrated the interconnection between the various secretory processes. Extension of this strategy to other logically connected gene subsets in yeast and higher eukaryotes should provide critical insights into the functional/organizational principles of biological systems.},

  abstract = {Evidence for an error-free DNA damage tolerance process in eukaryotes (also called postreplication repair) has existed for more than two decades, but its underlying mechanism, although known to be different from that in prokaryotes, has remained elusive. We have investigated this mechanism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which it is the major component of the RAD6/RAD18 pathway, by transforming an isogenic set of rad1Delta excision-defective strains with plasmids that carry a single thymine-thymine pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidinone photoadduct in each strand at staggered positions 28 base pairs apart. C-C mismatches placed opposite each of the T-T photoproducts permit unambiguous detection of the events that can lead to the completion of replication: sister-strand recombination or translesion replication on one or the other strand. Despite the severe block to replication that these lesions impose, we find that more than half of the plasmids were fully replicated in a rad1Delta strain and that >90% of them achieved this end by recombination between partially replicated sister strands within the interlesion region. Approximately 60-70% of these events depended on the error-free component of the RAD6/RAD18 pathway, with the remaining events depended on RAD52; these two processes account for almost all of the recombination, which depended neither on DNA polymerase zeta nor on mismatch repair. We conclude that the error-free component of the RAD6/RAD18 pathway completes replication by a mechanism employing recombination between partially replicated sister strands, possibly by means of transient template strand switching or copy choice.},

  abstract = {Gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs) are frequently observed in many cancers. Previously, we showed that inactivation of Rad5 or Rad18, ubiquitin ligases (E3) targeting for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), increases the de novo telomere addition type of GCR (S. Smith, J. Y. Hwang, S. Banerjee, A. Majeed, A. Gupta, and K. Myung, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 101:9039-9044, 2004). GCR suppression by Rad5 and Rad18 appears to be exerted by the RAD5-dependent error-free mode of bypass DNA repair. In contrast, Siz1 SUMO ligase and another ubiquitin ligase, Bre1, which target for PCNA and histone H2B, respectively, have GCR-supporting activities. Inactivation of homologous recombination (HR) proteins or the helicase Srs2 reduces GCR rates elevated by the rad5 or rad18 mutation. GCRs are therefore likely to be produced through the restrained recruitment of an HR pathway to stalled DNA replication forks. Since this HR pathway is compatible with Srs2, it is not a conventional form of recombinational pathway. Lastly, we demonstrate that selection of proper DNA repair pathways to stalled DNA replication forks is controlled by the Mec1-dependent checkpoint and is executed by cooperative functions of Siz1 and Srs2. We propose a mechanism for how defects in these proteins could lead to diverse outcomes (proper repair or GCR formation) through different regulation of DNA repair machinery.},

Similarly, the HLTF gene was recently found to be inactivated by hypermethylation in a number of advanced colon and gastric tumors. However, other evidences indicated a 20-fold HLTF overexpression in cell lines derived from various neoplasms (ovary, breast, cervix, kidney...).
RESULTS: In the present study, we investigated HLTF expression by immunohistochemistry in a model of kidney tumors induced by continuous administration of diethylstilbestrol to male Syrian golden hamsters. A strong labeling was already detected in small tumor buds, making HLTF an early cancer marker in this model. Although every cell stained for HLTF at this early stage, the number of HLTF-positive cells decreased to 10% with cancer progression, and these positive cells were dispersed in the tumor mass. HLTF expression was conserved in the HKT-1097 cell line established from kidney tumors, but again only 10% of positive cells were found in xenografts produced by HKT-1097 cells in nude mice.

HLTF expression was conserved in the HKT-1097 cell line established from kidney tumors, but again only 10% of positive cells were found in xenografts produced by HKT-1097 cells in nude mice.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our data suggest that HLTF gene activation is linked to initial steps of carcinogenesis in this model and should be investigated in early stages of other neoplasms.},

  abstract = {The anticancer agents cisplatin and oxaliplatin are widely used in the treatment of human neoplasias. A genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae previously identified PPH3 and PSY2 among the top 20 genes conferring resistance to these anticancer agents. The mammalian orthologue of Pph3p is the protein serine/threonine phosphatase Ppp4c, which is found in high molecular mass complexes bound to a regulatory subunit R2. We show here that the putative S. cerevisiae orthologue of R2, which is encoded by ORF YBL046w, binds to Pph3p and exhibits the same unusually high asymmetry as mammalian R2. Despite the essential function of Ppp4c-R2 in microtubule-related processes at centrosomes in higher eukaryotes, S. cerevisiae diploid strains with homozygous deletion of YBL046w and two or one functional copies of the TUB2 gene were viable and no more sensitive to microtubule-depolymerizing drugs than the control strain. The protein encoded by YBL046w exhibited a predominantly nuclear localization. These studies suggest that the centrosomal function of Ppp4c-R2 is not required or may be performed by a different phosphatase in yeast. Homozygous diploid deletion strains of S. cerevisiae, pph3Delta, ybl046wDelta and psy2Delta, were all more sensitive to cisplatin than the control strain. The YBL046w gene therefore confers resistance to cisplatin and was termed PSY4 (platinum sensitivity 4). Ppp4c, R2 and the putative orthologue of Psy2p (termed R3) are shown here to form a complex in Drosophila melanogaster and mammalian cells. By comparison with the yeast system, this complex may confer resistance to cisplatin in higher eukaryotes.},

Rad5 is an SWI/SNF family ATPase, and additionally, it functions as a ubiquitin ligase in the ubiquitin conjugation reaction. To decipher the roles of these Rad5 activities in lesion bypass, here we examine the effects of mutations in the Rad5 ATPase and ubiquitin ligase domains on the PRR of UV-damaged DNA and on UV-induced mutagenesis. Even though the ATPase-defective mutation confers only a modest degree of UV sensitivity whereas the ubiquitin ligase mutation causes a high degree of UV sensitivity, we find that both of these mutations produce the same high level of PRR defect as that conferred by the highly UV-sensitive rad5Delta mutation. From these studies, we infer a requirement of the Rad5 ATPase and ubiquitin ligase activities in PRR, and based upon the effects of different rad5 mutations on UV mutagenesis, we suggest a role for Rad5 in affecting the efficiency of lesion bypass by the TLS polymerases. In contrast to the role of Rad5 in PRR, however, where its function is coupled with that of Mms2-Ubc13, Rad5 function in TLS would be largely independent of this ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme complex.},

New pol31 alleles were constructed by introducing mutations into conserved amino acid residues in all 10 identified regions of Pol31. Six novel temperature-sensitive (ts) or cold-sensitive (cs) alleles, carrying mutations in regions III, IV, VII, VIII or IX, conferred a range of defects in the response to replication stress or DNA damage. Deletion of SGS1, RAD52, SRS2, MRC1 or RAD24 had a deleterious effect only in combination with those pol31 alleles that had a phenotype as single mutants, suggesting a requirement for recombination and checkpoint functions in processing the DNA lesions or structures that form as a consequence of replication with a defective Pol delta. In contrast, deletion of POL32 negatively affected the growth of almost all pol31 mutants, suggesting an important role for all conserved amino acids of Pol31 in maintaining the integrity of Pol delta complex structurally, at least in the absence of the third subunit. Surprisingly, deletions of RAD18 and MGS1 aggravated the temperature sensitivity conferred by most ts or cs alleles and specifically suppressed the hys2-1 and hys2-1-like mutations of POL31. Deletion of RAD5 or MMS2 had an effect on pol31 ts/cs mutants similar to that of RAD18, whereas deletion of RAD30 or REV3 had no effect. We propose that Rad18/Rad5/Mms2 and Mgs1 are required to promote replication when forks are destabilized or stalled due to defects in Pol delta. These data are consistent with the biochemical activity of the human Mgs1 orthologue, which binds and stimulates Pol deltain vitro. We also demonstrate that Mgs1 interacts physically with Pol31 in vivo. Moreover, regions I and VII of Pol31, which are specifically sensitive to high levels of Mgs1 and PCNA, could be sites of interaction.},

  abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA replication stress activates the replication checkpoint, which slows S-phase progression, stabilizes slowed or stalled replication forks, and relieves inhibition of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) complex. To identify novel genes that promote cellular viability after replication stress, the S. cerevisiae non-essential haploid gene deletion set (4812 strains) was screened for sensitivity to the RNR inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU). Strains bearing deletions in either CCR4 or CAF1/POP2, which encode components of the cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylase complex, were particularly sensitive to HU. We found that Ccr4 cooperated with the Dun1 branch of the replication checkpoint, such that ccr4Delta dun1Delta strains exhibited irreversible hypersensitivity to HU and persistent activation of Rad53. Moreover, because ccr4Delta and chk1Delta exhibited epistasis in several genetic contexts, we infer that Ccr4 and Chk1 act in the same pathway to overcome replication stress. A counterscreen for suppressors of ccr4Delta HU sensitivity uncovered mutations in CRT1, which encodes the transcriptional repressor of the DNA-damage-induced gene regulon. Whereas Dun1 is known to inhibit Crt1 repressor activity, we found that Ccr4 regulates CRT1 mRNA poly(A) tail length and may subtly influence Crt1 protein abundance. Simultaneous overexpression of RNR2, RNR3 and RNR4 partially rescued the HU hypersensitivity of a ccr4Delta dun1Delta strain, consistent with the notion that the RNR genes are key targets of Crt1. These results implicate the coordinated regulation of Crt1 via Ccr4 and Dun1 as a crucial nodal point in the response to DNA replication stress.},

  abstract = {Screening the Saccharomyces cerevisiae homozygous diploid deletion library against a sublethal concentration of cisplatin revealed 76 strains sensitive to the drug. As expected, the largest category of deletions, representing 40% of the sensitive strains, was composed of strains lacking genes involved in DNA replication and damage repair. Deletions lacking function of the highly conserved vacuolar H+ translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) composed the category representing the second largest number of sensitive strains. The effect on cell death exhibited by V-ATPase mutants was found to be a general response to various DNA damaging agents as opposed to being specific to cisplatin, as evidenced by sensitivity of the mutants to hydroxyurea (a DNA-alkylating agent) and UV irradiation. Loss of V-ATPase does not affect DNA repair, because double mutants defective for V-ATPase function and DNA repair pathways were more sensitive to cisplatin than the single mutants. V-ATPase mutants are more prone to DNA damage than wild-type cells, indicated by enhanced activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. Vacuole function per se is not cisplatin-sensitive, because vacuolar morphology and vacuolar acidification were unaffected by cisplatin in wild-type cells. V-ATPase also controls cytoplasmic pH, so the enhanced sensitivity to DNA damage may be associated with the drop in pHi associated with V-ATPase mutants. The increased loss in cell viability induced by cisplatin at lower pH in V-ATPase mutants supports this hypothesis. The loss in viability seen in wild-type cells under the same conditions was far less dramatic.},

  abstract = {Defining the functional relationships between proteins is critical for understanding virtually all aspects of cell biology. Large-scale identification of protein complexes has provided one important step towards this goal; however, even knowledge of the stoichiometry, affinity and lifetime of every protein-protein interaction would not reveal the functional relationships between and within such complexes. Genetic interactions can provide functional information that is largely invisible to protein-protein interaction data sets. Here we present an epistatic miniarray profile (E-MAP) consisting of quantitative pairwise measurements of the genetic interactions between 743 Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes involved in various aspects of chromosome biology (including DNA replication/repair, chromatid segregation and transcriptional regulation). This E-MAP reveals that physical interactions fall into two well-represented classes distinguished by whether or not the individual proteins act coherently to carry out a common function. Thus, genetic interaction data make it possible to dissect functionally multi-protein complexes, including Mediator, and to organize distinct protein complexes into pathways. In one pathway defined here, we show that Rtt109 is the founding member of a novel class of histone acetyltransferases responsible for Asf1-dependent acetylation of histone H3 on lysine 56. This modification, in turn, enables a ubiquitin ligase complex containing the cullin Rtt101 to ensure genomic integrity during DNA replication.},

GCRs comprise chromosome translocations, amplifications, inversions, deletion of whole chromosome arms, and interstitial deletions. Here, we report the results of a genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae aimed at identifying novel suppressors of GCR formation. The most potent novel GCR suppressor identified is BUD16, the gene coding for yeast pyridoxal kinase (Pdxk), a key enzyme in the metabolism of pyridoxal 5' phosphate (PLP), the biologically active form of vitamin B6. We show that Pdxk potently suppresses GCR events by curtailing the appearance of DNA lesions during the cell cycle. We also show that pharmacological inhibition of Pdxk in human cells leads to the production of DSBs and activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. Finally, our evidence suggests that PLP deficiency threatens genome integrity, most likely via its role in dTMP biosynthesis, as Pdxk-deficient cells accumulate uracil in their nuclear DNA and are sensitive to inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Since Pdxk links diet to genome stability, our work supports the hypothesis that dietary micronutrients reduce cancer risk by curtailing the accumulation of DNA damage and suggests that micronutrient depletion could be part of a defense mechanism against hyperproliferation.},

On model replication fork structures, Rad5 concertedly unwinds and anneals the nascent and the parental strands without exposing extended single-stranded regions.

From the studies presented here, we infer that replication through the 3meA lesion in yeast cells can be mediated by the action of three Rad6-Rad18-dependent pathways that include translesion synthesis (TLS) by Pol(eta) or -zeta and an Mms2-Ubc13-Rad5-dependent pathway which presumably operates via template switching. We also express human Pols iota and kappa in yeast cells and show that they too can mediate replication through the 3meA lesion in yeast cells, indicating a high degree of evolutionary conservation of the mechanisms that control TLS in yeast and human cells. We discuss these results in the context of previous observations that have been made for the roles of Pols eta, iota, and kappa in promoting replication through the minor-groove N2-dG adducts.},

Here, we examine the contributions of the RAD51, RAD52, and RAD54 genes and of the RAD50 and XRS2 genes to the PRR of UV-damaged DNA. We find that deletions of the RAD51, RAD52, and RAD54 genes impair the efficiency of PRR and that almost all of the PRR is inhibited in the absence of both Rad5 and Rad52. We suggest a role for the Rad5 pathway when the lesion is located on the leading strand template and for the Rad52 pathway when the lesion is located on the lagging strand template. We surmise that both of these pathways operate in a nonrecombinational manner, Rad5 by mediating replication fork regression and template switching via its DNA helicase activity and Rad52 via a synthesis-dependent strand annealing mode. In addition, our results suggest a role for the Rad50 and Xrs2 proteins and thereby for the MRX complex in promoting PRR via both the Rad5 and Rad52 pathways.},

  abstract = {Replication forks stall at DNA lesions or as a result of an unfavorable replicative environment. These fork stalling events have been associated with recombination and gross chromosomal rearrangements. Recombination and fork bypass pathways are the mechanisms accountable for restart of stalled forks. An important lesion bypass mechanism is the highly conserved post-replication repair (PRR) pathway that is composed of error-prone translesion and error-free bypass branches. EXO1 codes for a Rad2p family member nuclease that has been implicated in a multitude of eukaryotic DNA metabolic pathways that include DNA repair, recombination, replication, and telomere integrity. In this report, we show EXO1 functions in the MMS2 error-free branch of the PRR pathway independent of the role of EXO1 in DNA mismatch repair (MMR). Consistent with the idea that EXO1 functions independently in two separate pathways, we defined a domain of Exo1p required for PRR distinct from those required for interaction with MMR proteins. We then generated a point mutant exo1 allele that was defective for the function of Exo1p in MMR due to disrupted interaction with Mlh1p, but still functional for PRR. Lastly, by using a compound exo1 mutant that was defective for interaction with Mlh1p and deficient for nuclease activity, we provide further evidence that Exo1p plays both structural and catalytic roles during MMR.},

Both proteins have RING domains at their C termini. Such domains are common in ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like protein ligases (E3s), but little was known about the molecular functions of either protein. In this study we identified HEX3 as a high-copy suppressor of a temperature-sensitive small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) protease mutant, ulp1ts, suggesting that it may affect cellular SUMO dynamics. Remarkably, even a complete deletion of ULP1 is strongly suppressed. Hex3 forms a heterodimer with Slx8. We found that the Hex3.Slx8 complex has a robust substrate-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. In this E3 complex, Slx8 appears to bear the core ligase function, with Hex3 strongly enhancing its activity. Notably, SUMO attachment to a substrate stimulates its Hex3.Slx8-dependent ubiquitination, primarily through direct noncovalent interactions between SUMO and Hex3. Our data reveal a novel mechanism of substrate targeting in which sumoylation of a protein can help trigger its subsequent ubiquitination by recruiting a SUMO-binding ubiquitin ligase.},

For other nonrecurrent rearrangements, nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) is implicated. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD) is an X-linked dysmyelinating disorder caused most frequently (60%-70%) by nonrecurrent duplication of the dosage-sensitive proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene but also by nonrecurrent deletion or point mutations. Many PLP1 duplication junctions are refractory to breakpoint sequence analysis, an observation inconsistent with a simple recombination mechanism. Our current analysis of junction sequences in PMD patients confirms the occurrence of simple tandem PLP1 duplications but also uncovers evidence for sequence complexity at some junctions. These data are consistent with a replication-based mechanism that we term FoSTeS, for replication Fork Stalling and Template Switching. We propose that complex duplication and deletion rearrangements associated with PMD, and potentially other nonrecurrent rearrangements, may be explained by this replication-based mechanism.},

The YEATS family includes two human genes that are common fusion partners with MLL in human acute leukemias. Anc1 is a member of seven multi-protein complexes involved in transcription, and the damage sensitivity observed in anc1Delta cells is mirrored in strains deleted for some other non-essential members of several of these complexes. Here we show that ANC1 is in the same epistasis group as SRS2 and RAD5, members of the postreplication repair (PRR) pathway, but has additive or synergistic interactions with several other members of this pathway. Although PRR is traditionally divided into an {"}error-prone{"} and an {"}error-free{"} branch, ANC1 is not epistatic with all members of either established branch, and instead defines a new error-free branch of the PRR pathway. Like several genes involved in PRR, an intact ANC1 gene significantly suppresses spontaneous mutation rates, including the expansion of (CAG)(25) repeats. Anc1's role in the PRR pathway, as well as its role in suppressing triplet repeats, point to a possible mechanism for a protein of potential medical interest.},

Indeed, most DSB repair events occur by a non-crossover mechanism limiting loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for markers downstream of the site of repair and preventing chromosome rearrangements. However, DSBs that arise by replication fork collapse or by erosion of uncapped telomeres have only one free end and are thought to repair by strand invasion into a homologous duplex DNA followed by replication to the chromosome end (break-induced replication, BIR). As BIR from one of the two ends of a DSB would result in a long tract of LOH it suggests BIR is suppressed when DSBs have two ends in order for repair to occur by a more conservative HR mechanism. Recent studies showed that BIR can occur by several rounds of strand invasion, DNA synthesis and dissociation resulting in chromosome rearrangements when dissociation and reinvasion occur within dispersed repeated sequences. Thus template switching BIR can be highly mutagenic and this process could be important for genome evolution and disease development.},

In a screen for genes that promote GCR, we identified MPH1, which encodes a 3'-5' DNA helicase. Overexpression of Mph1p in yeast results in decreased efficiency of homologous recombination (HR) as well as delayed Rad51p recruitment to double-strand breaks (DSBs), which suggests that Mph1p promotes GCR by partially suppressing HR. A function for Mph1p in suppression of HR is further supported by the observation that deletion of both mph1 and srs2 synergistically sensitize cells to methyl methanesulfonate-induced DNA damage. The GCR-promoting activity of Mph1p appears to depend on its interaction with replication protein A (RPA). Consistent with this observation, excess Mph1p stabilizes RPA at DSBs. Furthermore, spontaneous RPA foci at DSBs are destabilized by the mph1Delta mutation. Therefore, Mph1p promotes GCR formation by partially suppressing HR, likely through its interaction with RPA.},

In this study, we took advantage of a high-density genotyping analysis of the BY (S288c) and RM strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of 123 derived spore progeny to identify the genetic loci that underlie a complex DNA repair sensitivity phenotype. This was accomplished by screening hybrid yeast progeny for sensitivity to a variety of DNA damaging agents. Both the BY and RM strains are resistant to the ultraviolet light-mimetic agent 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO); however, hybrid progeny from a BYxRM cross displayed varying sensitivities to the drug. We mapped a major quantitative trait locus (QTL), RAD5, and identified the exact polymorphism within this locus responsible for 4-NQO sensitivity. By using a backcrossing strategy along with array-assisted bulk segregant analysis, we identified one other locus, MKT1, and a QTL on Chromosome VII that also link to the hybrid 4-NQO-sensitive phenotype but confer more minor effects. This work suggests an additive model for sensitivity to 4-NQO and provides a strategy for mapping both major and minor QTL that confer background-specific phenotypes. It also provides tools for understanding the effect of genetic background on sensitivity to genotoxic agents.},

Cells have evolved lesion bypass pathways such as postreplication repair (PRR) to resolve these arrested forks. In yeast, one branch of PRR involves proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) polyubiquitination mediated by the Rad5-Ubc13-Mms2 complex that allows bypass of DNA lesion by a template-switching mechanism. Previously, we identified human SHPRH as a functional homologue of yeast Rad5 and revealed the existence of RAD5-like pathway in human cells. Here we report the identification of HLTF as a second RAD5 homologue in human cells. HLTF, like SHPRH, shares a unique domain architecture with Rad5 and promotes lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination of PCNA. Similar to yeast Rad5, HLTF is able to interact with UBC13 and PCNA, as well as SHPRH; and the reduction of either SHPRH or HLTF expression enhances spontaneous mutagenesis. Moreover, Hltf-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts show elevated chromosome breaks and fusions after methyl methane sulfonate treatment. Our results suggest that HLTF and SHPRH are functional homologues of yeast Rad5 that cooperatively mediate PCNA polyubiquitination and maintain genomic stability.},

Translocations produced in the smc6-9 strain are unique because they are non-reciprocal and dependent on break-induced replication (BIR) and independent of non-homologous end joining. The high incidence of translocations near repetitive sequences such as delta sequences, ARS, tRNA genes, and telomeres in the smc6-9 strain indicates that Smc5-Smc6 suppresses translocations by reducing DNA damage at repetitive sequences. Synergistic enhancements of translocations in strains defective in DNA damage checkpoints by the smc6-9 mutation without affecting de novo telomere addition class GCR suggest that Smc5-Smc6 defines a new pathway to suppress GCR formation.},

Both these activities are important for Rad5's ability to function in PRR. Here we provide evidence for the requirement of Rad5 in TLS mediated by Polzeta. Using duplex plasmids carrying different site-specific DNA lesions--an abasic site, a cis-syn TT dimer, a (6-4) TT photoproduct, or a G-AAF adduct--we show that Rad5 is needed for Polzeta-dependent TLS. Rad5 action in this role is likely to be structural, since neither the inactivation of its ubiquitin ligase activity nor the inactivation of its helicase activity impairs its role in TLS.},

Lsmlp is a member of a cytoplasmic complex composed of Lsmlp-7p that interacts with the yeast mRNA degradation machinery. To investigate the potential role of Lsmlp in response to UV radiation, we constructed double mutant strains in which LSM1 was deleted in combination with a representative gene from each of three known yeast DNA repair pathways. Our results show that lsm1delta increases the UV-radiation sensitivity of the rad1delta and rad51delta mutants, but not the radl8delta mutant, placing LSM1 within the post-replication repair/damage tolerance pathway (PRR). When combined with other deletions affecting PRR, lsm1delta increases the UV-radiation sensitivity of the rev3delta, rad30delta and pol30-K164R mutants but not rad5delta. Furthermore, the UV-radiation sensitivity phenotype of lsmldelta is partially rescued by mutations in genes involved in 3' to 5' mRNA degradation, and mutations predicted to function in RNA interactions confer the most UV-radiation sensitivity. Together, these results suggest that Lsmlp may confer protection against UV-radiation damage by protecting the 3' ends of mRNAs from exosome-dependent 3' to 5' degradation as part of a novel RAD5-mediated, PCNA-K164 ubiquitylation-independent subpathway of PRR.},

  abstract = {We present a new technique called {"}t-SNE{"} that visualizes high-dimensional data by giving each datapoint a location in a two or three-dimensional map. The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza- tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

Error-prone replication involves translesion polymerases and requires monoubiquitylation at lysine (K) 164 of PCNA by the Rad6 and Rad18 enzymes.

Mutant cells that are completely deficient in PCNA ubiquitylation, repair plasmids by HDR similar to wild-type cells. These findings are consistent with a model in which unmodified PCNA supports HDR, whereas PCNA monoubiquitylation diverts repair to NHEJ, which is suppressed by PCNA polyubiquitylation.

  abstract = {Selenium toxicity is a growing environmental concern due to widespread availability of high-dose selenium supplements and the development of high-selenium agricultural drainage basins. To begin to analyze the effects of selenium toxicity at the genetic level, we have systematically determined which genes are involved in responding to high environmental selenium using a collection of viable haploid null allele strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae representing three major stress pathways: the RAD9-dependent DNA repair pathway, the RAD6/RAD18 DNA damage tolerance pathway, and the oxidative stress pathway. A total of 53 null allele strains were tested for growth defects in the presence of a range of sodium selenite and selenomethionine (SeMet) concentrations. Our results show that approximately 64-72% of the strains lacking RAD9-dependent DNA repair or RAD6/RAD18 DNA damage tolerance pathway genes show reduced growth in sodium selenite versus approximately 28-36% in SeMet. Interestingly both compounds reduced growth in approximately 21-25% of the strains lacking oxidative stress genes. These data suggest that both selenite and SeMet are likely inducing DNA damage by generating reactive species. The anticipated effects of loss of components of the oxidative stress pathway were not observed, likely due to apparent redundancies in these gene products that may keep the damaging effects in check.},

Here, we show that imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines and imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidines compose a class of compounds that target essential, conserved cellular processes. Using validated chemogenomic assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we discovered that two closely related compounds, an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine and -pyrimidine that differ by a single atom, have distinctly different mechanisms of action in vivo. 2-phenyl-3-nitroso-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine was toxic to yeast strains with defects in electron transport and mitochondrial functions and caused mitochondrial fragmentation, suggesting that compound 13 acts by disrupting mitochondria. By contrast, 2-phenyl-3-nitroso-imidazo[1,2-a]pyrimidine acted as a DNA poison, causing damage to the nuclear DNA and inducing mutagenesis. We compared compound 15 to known chemotherapeutics and found resistance required intact DNA repair pathways. Thus, subtle changes in the structure of imidazo-pyridines and -pyrimidines dramatically alter both the intracellular targeting of these compounds and their effects in vivo. Of particular interest, these different modes of action were evident in experiments on human cells, suggesting that chemical-genetic profiles obtained in yeast are recapitulated in cultured cells, indicating that our observations in yeast can: (1) be leveraged to determine mechanism of action in mammalian cells and (2) suggest novel structure-activity relationships.},

  abstract = {In nature, organisms are exposed to chronic low-dose ultraviolet light (CLUV) as opposed to the acute high doses common to laboratory experiments. Analysis of the cellular response to acute high-dose exposure has delineated the importance of direct DNA repair by the nucleotide excision repair pathway and for checkpoint-induced cell cycle arrest in promoting cell survival. Here we examine the response of yeast cells to CLUV and identify a key role for the RAD6-RAD18-RAD5 error-free postreplication repair (RAD6 error-free PRR) pathway in promoting cell growth and survival. We show that loss of the RAD6 error-free PRR pathway results in DNA-damage-checkpoint-induced G2 arrest in CLUV-exposed cells, whereas wild-type and nucleotide-excision-repair-deficient cells are largely unaffected. Cell cycle arrest in the absence of the RAD6 error-free PRR pathway was not caused by a repair defect or by the accumulation of ultraviolet-induced photoproducts. Notably, we observed increased replication protein A (RPA)- and Rad52-yellow fluorescent protein foci in the CLUV-exposed rad18Delta cells and demonstrated that Rad52-mediated homologous recombination is required for the viability of the rad18Delta cells after release from CLUV-induced G2 arrest. These and other data presented suggest that, in response to environmental levels of ultraviolet exposure, the RAD6 error-free PRR pathway promotes replication of damaged templates without the generation of extensive single-stranded DNA regions. Thus, the error-free PRR pathway is specifically important during chronic low-dose ultraviolet exposure to prevent counter-productive DNA checkpoint activation and allow cells to proliferate normally.},

Quantitative genetic interaction mapping reveals factors working in compensatory pathways (negative genetic interactions) or those operating in linear pathways (positive genetic interactions). We found an enrichment of positive genetic interactions between kinases, phosphatases, and their substrates. In addition, we assembled a higher-order map from sets of three genes that display strong interactions with one another: triplets enriched for functional connectivity. The resulting network view provides insights into signaling pathway regulation and reveals a link between the cell-cycle kinase, Cak1, the Fus3 MAP kinase, and a pathway that regulates chromatin integrity during transcription by RNA polymerase II.},

Here we show that the complex is recruited to sites of paused forks where it stabilizes the association of essential replisome components. Interestingly, this function is not dependent on the S phase checkpoint or the nuclease activity of Mre11. We find that disruption of the MRX complex leads to a loss of fork recovery and a failure to properly complete DNA replication when cells are exposed to replication stress. Our data suggest that one critical function of the MRX complex during replication is to promote the cohesion of sister chromatids at paused forks, offering an explanation for why MRX deficiency leads to a loss of cell viability and high levels of chromosome rearrangements under conditions of replication stress.},

Bypass of cell cycle control occurs with an increased rate of mutation. Both pol3-14 and hmo1Delta are mutators and their combination provokes a synergistic rate of CAN1 mutations. RAD18 controls branches of DNA repair pathways and its deletion also suppresses pol3 mutations. Comparing hmo1Delta and rad18Delta suppression of pol3-14 shows that while both require the presence of RAD52-mediated repair, their suppression is independent in that both can suppress in the presence of the other. We conclude that hmo1Delta suppression of pol3-14 occurs by a mechanism whereby normal controls on DNA integrity are breached and lesions flow into RAD52-mediated repair and error-prone pathways.},

Here we provide evidence that human genomic rearrangements ranging in size from several megabases to a few hundred base pairs can be generated by FoSTeS/MMBIR. Furthermore, we show that FoSTeS/MMBIR-mediated rearrangements can occur mitotically and can result in duplication or triplication of individual genes or even rearrangements of single exons. The FoSTeS/MMBIR mechanism can explain both the gene duplication-divergence hypothesis and exon shuffling, suggesting an important role in both genome and single-gene evolution.},

  abstract = {Mutations in SMARCAL1 (HARP) cause Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SIOD). The mechanistic basis for this disease is unknown. Using functional genomic screens, we identified SMARCAL1 as a genome maintenance protein. Silencing and overexpression of SMARCAL1 leads to activation of the DNA damage response during S phase in the absence of any genotoxic agent. SMARCAL1 contains a Replication protein A (RPA)-binding motif similar to that found in the replication stress response protein TIPIN (Timeless-Interacting Protein), which is both necessary and sufficient to target SMARCAL1 to stalled replication forks. RPA binding is critical for the cellular function of SMARCAL1; however, it is not necessary for the annealing helicase activity of SMARCAL1 in vitro. An SIOD-associated SMARCAL1 mutant fails to prevent replication-associated DNA damage from accumulating in cells in which endogenous SMARCAL1 is silenced. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ATM and Rad3-related (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) phosphorylate SMARCAL1 in response to replication stress. Loss of SMARCAL1 activity causes increased RPA loading onto chromatin and persistent RPA phosphorylation after a transient exposure to replication stress. Furthermore, SMARCAL1-deficient cells are hypersensitive to replication stress agents. Thus, SMARCAL1 is a replication stress response protein, and the pleiotropic phenotypes of SIOD are at least partly due to defects in genome maintenance during DNA replication.},

This promotes error-free bypass of DNA damage lesions. The unusual ability of Ubc13-Mms2 to synthesize unanchored Lys(63)-linked polyUb chains in vitro allowed us to resolve the individual roles that it and Rad5 play in the catalysis and specificity of PCNA polyubiquitination. We found that Rad5 stimulates the synthesis of free polyUb chains by Ubc13-Mms2 in part by enhancing the reactivity of the Ubc13 approximately Ub thiolester bond. Polyubiquitination of monoUb-PCNA was further enhanced by interactions between the N-terminal domain of Rad5 and PCNA. Thus, Rad5 acts both to align monoUb-PCNA with Ub-charged Ubc13 and to stimulate Ub transfer onto Lys(63) of a Ub acceptor. We also found that Rad5 interacts with PCNA independently of the number of monoubiquitinated subunits in the trimer and that it binds to both unmodified and monoUb-PCNA with similar affinities. These findings indicate that Rad5-mediated recognition of monoUb-PCNA in vivo is likely to depend upon interactions with additional factors at stalled replication forks.},

  abstract = {The integrity of genomic DNA is continuously challenged by the presence of DNA base lesions or DNA strand breaks. Here we report the identification of a new DNA damage response protein, SMARCAL1 (SWI/SNF-related, matrix associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a-like 1), which is a member of the SNF2 family and is mutated in Schimke immunoosseous dysplasia (SIOD). We demonstrate that SMARCAL1 directly interacts with Replication protein A (RPA) and is recruited to sites of DNA damage in an RPA-dependent manner. SMARCAL1-depleted cells display sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents that induce replication fork collapse, and exhibit slower fork recovery and delayed entry into mitosis following S-phase arrest. Furthermore, SIOD patient fibroblasts reconstituted with SMARCAL1 exhibit faster cell cycle progression after S-phase arrest. Thus, the symptoms of SIOD may be caused, at least in part, by defects in the cellular response to DNA replication stress.},

  abstract = {The Asf1 and Rad6 pathways have been implicated in a number of common processes such as suppression of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs), DNA repair, modification of chromatin, and proper checkpoint functions. We examined the relationship between Asf1 and different gene products implicated in postreplication repair (PRR) pathways in the suppression of GCRs, checkpoint function, sensitivity to hydroxyurea (HU) and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and ubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). We found that defects in Rad6 PRR pathway and Siz1/Srs2 homologous recombination suppression (HRS) pathway genes suppressed the increased GCR rates seen in asf1 mutants, which was independent of translesion bypass polymerases but showed an increased dependency on Dun1. Combining an asf1 deletion with different PRR mutations resulted in a synergistic increase in sensitivity to chronic HU and MMS treatment; however, these double mutants were not checkpoint defective, since they were capable of recovering from acute treatment with HU. Interestingly, we found that Asf1 and Rad6 cooperate in ubiquitination of PCNA, indicating that Rad6 and Asf1 function in parallel pathways that ubiquitinate PCNA. Our results show that ASF1 probably contributes to the maintenance of genome stability through multiple mechanisms, some of which involve the PRR and HRS pathways.},

  abstract = {Poly-ubiquitylation is a common post-translational modification that can impart various functions to a target protein. Several distinct mechanisms have been reported for the assembly of poly-ubiquitin chains, involving either stepwise transfer of ubiquitin monomers or attachment of a preformed poly-ubiquitin chain and requiring either a single pair of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and ubiquitin ligase (E3), or alternatively combinations of different E2s and E3s. We have analysed the mechanism of poly-ubiquitylation of the replication clamp PCNA by two cooperating E2-E3 pairs, Rad6-Rad18 and Ubc13-Mms2-Rad5. We find that the two complexes act sequentially and independently in chain initiation and stepwise elongation, respectively. While loading of PCNA onto DNA is essential for recognition by Rad6-Rad18, chain extension by Ubc13-Mms2-Rad5 is only slightly enhanced by loading. Moreover, in contrast to initiation, chain extension is tolerant to variations in the attachment site of the proximal ubiquitin moiety. Our results provide information about a unique conjugation mechanism that appears to be specialised for a regulatable pattern of dual modification.},

Mutations in SMARCAL1 are associated with the disease Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia, a multisystem autosomal recessive disorder characterized by T cell immunodeficiency, growth inhibition, and renal dysfunction. The cellular function of SMARCAL1, however, is unknown. Here, using Xenopus egg extracts and mass spectrometry, we identify SMARCAL1 as a protein recruited to double-stranded DNA breaks. SMARCAL1 binds to double-stranded breaks and stalled replication forks in both egg extract and human cells, specifically colocalizing with the single-stranded DNA binding factor RPA. In addition, SMARCAL1 interacts physically with RPA independently of DNA. SMARCAL1 is phosphorylated in a caffeine-sensitive manner in response to double-stranded breaks and stalled replication forks. It has been suggested that stalled forks can be stabilized by a mechanism involving caffeine-sensitive kinases, or they collapse and subsequently recruit Rad51 to promote homologous recombination repair. We show that depletion of SMARCAL1 from U2OS cells leads to increased frequency of RAD51 foci upon generation of stalled replication forks, indicating that fork breakdown is more prevalent in the absence of SMARCAL1. We propose that SMARCAL1 is a novel DNA damage-binding protein involved in replication fork stabilization.},

In addition, recombination and replication are inextricably linked, as recombination recovers stalled and broken replication forks, enabling the evolution of larger genomes/replicons. Defects in recombination lead to genomic instability and elevated cancer predisposition, demonstrating a clear cellular need for recombination. However, recombination can also lead to genome rearrangements. Unrestrained recombination causes undesired endpoints (translocation, deletion, inversion) and the accumulation of toxic recombination intermediates. Evidently, HR must be carefully regulated to match specific cellular needs. Here, we review the factors and mechanistic stages of recombination that are subject to regulation and suggest that recombination achieves flexibility and robustness by proceeding through metastable, reversible intermediates.},

While translesion synthesis pathways are highly conserved from yeast to humans, very little is known of a Rad5-like pathway in human cells. Here we show that a human homologue of Rad5, HLTF, can facilitate fork regression and has a role in replication of damaged DNA. We found that HLTF is able to reverse model replication forks, a process which depends on its double-stranded DNA translocase activity. Furthermore, from analysis of isolated dually labeled chromosomal fibers, we demonstrate that in vivo, HLTF promotes the restart of replication forks blocked at DNA lesions. These findings suggest that HLTF can promote error-free replication of damaged DNA and support a role for HLTF in preventing mutagenesis and carcinogenesis, providing thereby for its potential tumor suppressor role.},

Here we show that BIR requires the replicative DNA helicase (Cdc45, the GINS, and Mcm2-7 proteins) as well as Cdt1. In contrast, both subunits of origin recognition complex (ORC) and Cdc6, which are required to create a prereplication complex (pre-RC), are dispensable. The Cdc7 kinase, required for both initiation of DNA replication and post-replication repair (PRR), is also required for BIR. Ubiquitination and sumoylation of the DNA processivity clamp PCNA play modest roles; in contrast, PCNA alleles that suppress pol32Delta's cold sensitivity fail to suppress its role in BIR, and are by themselves dominant inhibitors of BIR. These results suggest that origin-independent BIR involves cross-talk between normal DNA replication factors and PRR.},

Rad5, a PCNA polyubiquitin ligase and DNA-dependent ATPase in yeast, is orthologous to putative tumor suppressors and controls error-free damage bypass by an unknown mechanism. To identify the mechanism in vivo, we investigated the roles of Rad5 and analyzed the DNA structures that form during damage bypass at site-specific stalled forks present at replication origins. Rad5 mediated the formation of recombination-dependent, X-shaped DNA structures containing Holliday junctions between sister chromatids. Mutants lacking these damage-induced chromatid junctions were defective in resolving stalled forks, restarting replication, and completing chromosome duplication. Rad5 polyubiquitin ligase and ATPase domains both contributed to replication fork recombination. Our results indicate that multiple activities of Rad5 function coordinately with homologous recombination factors to enable replication template switch events that join sister chromatids at stalled forks and bypass DNA damage.},

To reveal the mechanism, we determined three structures of the Y-family DNA polymerase, Dpo4, in complex with Pt-GG DNA. The crystallographic snapshots show three stages of lesion bypass: the nucleotide insertions opposite the 3'G (first insertion) and 5'G (second insertion) of Pt-GG, and the primer extension beyond the lesion site. We observed a dynamic process, in which the lesion was converted from an open and angular conformation at the first insertion to a depressed and nearly parallel conformation at the subsequent reaction stages to fit into the active site of Dpo4. The DNA translocation-coupled conformational change may account for additional inhibition on the second insertion reaction. The structures illustrate that Pt-GG disturbs the replicating base pair in the active site, which reduces the catalytic efficiency and fidelity. The in vivo relevance of Dpo4-mediated Pt-GG bypass was addressed by a dpo-4 knockout strain of Sulfolobus solfataricus, which exhibits enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin and proteomic alterations consistent with genomic stress.},

  abstract = {Replication-associated recombinational repair is important for genome duplication and cell survival under DNA damage conditions. Several nonclassical recombination factors have been implicated in this process, but their functional relationships are not clear. Here, we show that three of these factors, Mph1, Mms2, and the Shu complex, can act independently to promote the formation of recombination intermediates during impaired replication. However, their functions become detrimental when cells lack the Smc5/6 complex or Esc2. We show that mph1Delta, mms2Delta, and shu1Delta suppress the sensitivity to the replication-blocking agent methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) in smc6 mutants, with double deletions conferring stronger suppression. These deletion mutations also rescue the MMS sensitivity of esc2Delta cells. In addition, two-dimensional gel analysis demonstrates that mph1Delta, mms2Delta, and shu1Delta each reduce the level of recombination intermediates in an smc6 mutant when cells replicate in the presence of MMS, and that double deletions lead to a greater reduction. Our work thus suggests that Mph1, Mms2, and the Shu complex can function in distinct pathways in replication-associated recombinational repair and that the Smc5/6 complex and Esc2 prevent the accumulation of toxic recombination intermediates generated in these processes.},

Also better resolved are the deoxyribose sugar puckers, which allow us to re-examine the global structure of platinum-modified DNA. Another new feature of this model is the location of four octahedral [Mg(H(2)O)(6)](2+) ions associated with bases in the DNA major groove and the identification of 124 ordered water molecules that participate in hydrogen-bonding interactions with either the nucleic acid or the diammineplatinum(II) moiety.},

The DDR is a complex signal transduction pathway that has the ability to sense DNA damage and transduce this information to the cell to influence cellular responses to DNA damage. Cells possess an arsenal of enzymatic tools capable of remodeling and repairing DNA; however, their activities must be tightly regulated in a temporal, spatial, and DNA lesion-appropriate fashion to optimize repair and prevent unnecessary and potentially deleterious alterations in the structure of DNA during normal cellular processes.

Previously it was shown that the loss of RAD6-dependent error-free postreplication repair (PRR) results in DNA damage checkpoint-mediated G(2) arrest in cells exposed to chronic low-dose UV radiation (CLUV), whereas wild-type and nucleotide excision repair-deficient cells are largely unaffected. In this study, we report that suppression of homologous recombination (HR) in PRR-deficient cells by Srs2 and PCNA sumoylation is required for checkpoint activation and checkpoint maintenance during CLUV irradiation. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK1)-dependent phosphorylation of Srs2 did not influence checkpoint-mediated G(2) arrest or maintenance in PRR-deficient cells but was critical for HR-dependent checkpoint recovery following release from CLUV exposure. These results indicate that Srs2 plays an important role in checkpoint-mediated reversible G(2) arrest in PRR-deficient cells via two separate HR-dependent mechanisms. The first (required to suppress HR during PRR) is regulated by PCNA sumoylation, whereas the second (required for HR-dependent recovery following CLUV exposure) is regulated by CDK1-dependent phosphorylation.},

Among them, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) loci together with cas (CRISPR-associated) genes form the CRISPR/Cas immune system, which involves partially palindromic repeats separated by short stretches of DNA called spacers, acquired from extrachromosomal elements. It was recently demonstrated that these variable loci can incorporate spacers from infecting bacteriophages and then provide immunity against subsequent bacteriophage infections in a sequence-specific manner. Here we show that the Streptococcus thermophilus CRISPR1/Cas system can also naturally acquire spacers from a self-replicating plasmid containing an antibiotic-resistance gene, leading to plasmid loss. Acquired spacers that match antibiotic-resistance genes provide a novel means to naturally select bacteria that cannot uptake and disseminate such genes. We also provide in vivo evidence that the CRISPR1/Cas system specifically cleaves plasmid and bacteriophage double-stranded DNA within the proto-spacer, at specific sites. Our data show that the CRISPR/Cas immune system is remarkably adapted to cleave invading DNA rapidly and has the potential for exploitation to generate safer microbial strains.},

We identified several experimental sources of systematic variation and developed normalization strategies to obtain accurate single- and double-mutant fitness measurements, which rival the accuracy of other high-resolution studies.

We previously showed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that nearby inverted repeat sequences (∼20-200 bp of homology, separated by ∼1-5 kb) frequently fuse to form unstable dicentric and acentric chromosomes. Here we analyzed inverted repeat fusion in mutants of three sets of genes. First, we show that genes in the error-free postreplication repair (PRR) pathway prevent fusion of inverted repeats, while genes in the translesion branch have no detectable role. Second, we found that siz1 mutants, which are defective for Srs2 recruitment to replication forks, and srs2 mutants had opposite effects on instability. This may reflect separate roles for Srs2 in different phases of the cell cycle. Third, we provide evidence for a faulty template switch model by studying mutants of DNA polymerases; defects in DNA pol delta (lagging strand polymerase) and Mgs1 (a pol delta interacting protein) lead to a defect in fusion events as well as allelic recombination. Pol delta and Mgs1 may collaborate either in strand annealing and/or DNA replication involved in fusion and allelic recombination events. Fourth, by studying genes implicated in suppression of GCRs in other studies, we found that inverted repeat fusion has a profile of genetic regulation distinct from these other major forms of GCR formation.},

Although the maturation of crRNAs represents a key event in CRISPR activation, the responsible endoribonucleases (CasE, Cas6, Csy4) are missing in many CRISPR/Cas subtypes. Here, differential RNA sequencing of the human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes uncovered tracrRNA, a trans-encoded small RNA with 24-nucleotide complementarity to the repeat regions of crRNA precursor transcripts. We show that tracrRNA directs the maturation of crRNAs by the activities of the widely conserved endogenous RNase III and the CRISPR-associated Csn1 protein; all these components are essential to protect S. pyogenes against prophage-derived DNA. Our study reveals a novel pathway of small guide RNA maturation and the first example of a host factor (RNase III) required for bacterial RNA-mediated immunity against invaders.},

In yeast, Rad5-mediated damage avoidance and Rad18-mediated translesion synthesis (TLS) are two forms of PRR. Two Rad5-related proteins, SHPRH and HLTF, have been identified in mammalian cells, but their specific roles in PRR are unclear. Here, we show that HLTF and SHPRH suppress mutagenesis in a damage-specific manner, preventing mutations induced by UV and MMS, respectively. Following UV, HLTF enhances PCNA monoubiquitination and recruitment of TLS polymerase η, while also inhibiting SHPRH function. In contrast, MMS promotes the degradation of HLTF and the interactions of SHPRH with Rad18 and polymerase κ. Our data suggest not only that cells differentially utilize HLTF and SHPRH for different forms of DNA damage, but also, surprisingly, that HLTF and SHPRH may coordinate the two main branches of PRR to choose the proper bypass mechanism for minimizing mutagenesis.},

RAD59 is required for RAD51-independent inverted-repeat recombination, but no clear mechanism for how recombination occurs in the absence of RAD51 has emerged. Because Rad59 is thought to function as an accessory factor for the single-strand annealing activity of Rad52 one possible mechanism for spontaneous recombination could be by strand annealing between repeats at a stalled replication fork. Here we demonstrate the importance of the Rad52 single-strand annealing activity for generating recombinants by showing suppression of the rad52Δ, rad51Δ rad52Δ and rad52Δ rad59Δ inverted-repeat recombination defects by the rfa1-D228Y mutation. In addition, formation of recombinants in the rad51Δ mutant was sensitive to the distance between the inverted repeats, consistent with a replication-based mechanism. Deletion of RAD5 or RAD18, which are required for error-free post-replication repair, reduced the recombination rate in the rad59Δ mutant, but not in wild type. These data are consistent with RAD51-independent recombinants arising by a faulty template switch mechanism that is distinct from nascent strand template switching.},

This modification activates recombination-like DNA damage-avoidance mechanisms, which function in an error-free manner. Cells deprived of Mms2, Ubc13 or Rad5 exhibit mutator phenotypes as a result of the channelling of premutational DNA lesions to often error-prone translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). Here we show that Siz1-mediated PCNA SUMOylation is required for the stimulation of this TLS, despite the presence of PCNA monoubiquitination. The stimulation of spontaneous mutagenesis by Siz1 in cells carrying rad5 and/or mms2 mutations is connected with the known role of PCNA SUMOylation in the inhibition of Rad52-mediated recombination. However, following UV irradiation, Siz1 is engaged in additional, as yet undefined, mechanisms controlling genetic stability at the replication fork. We also demonstrate that in the absence of PCNA SUMOylation, Mms2-Ubc13 and Rad5 may, independently of each other, function in the stimulation of TLS. Based on this finding and on an analysis of the epistatic relationships between SIZ1, MMS2 and RAD5, with respect to UV sensitivity, we conclude that PCNA SUMOylation is responsible for the functional differences between the Mms2 and Rad5 homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe.},

Important insights have come from studies of individuals with Fanconi anaemia (FA), a rare genetic disorder that leads to ICL sensitivity. Understanding how the FA pathway links nucleases, helicases and other DNA-processing enzymes should lead to more targeted uses of ICL-inducing agents in cancer treatment and could provide novel insights into drug resistance.},

However, a stalled replication fork is surrounded by various DNA-binding proteins which can inhibit the access of damage bypass players, and it is unknown how these proteins become displaced. Here we reveal that HLTF has an ATP hydrolysis-dependent protein remodeling activity, by which it can remove proteins bound to the replication fork. Moreover, we demonstrate that HLTF can displace a broad spectrum of proteins such as replication protein A (RPA), PCNA, and replication factor C (RFC), thereby providing the first example for a protein clearing activity at the stalled replication fork. Our findings clarify how remodeling of a stalled replication fork can occur if it is engaged in interactions with masses of proteins.},

CRISPR loci integrate short DNA sequences from invading genetic elements that provide small RNA-mediated interference in subsequent exposure to matching nucleic acids. In Streptococcus thermophilus, it was previously shown that the CRISPR1/Cas system can provide adaptive immunity against phages and plasmids by integrating novel spacers following exposure to these foreign genetic elements that subsequently direct the specific cleavage of invasive homologous DNA sequences. Here, we show that the S. thermophilus CRISPR3/Cas system can be transferred into Escherichia coli and provide heterologous protection against plasmid transformation and phage infection. We show that interference is sequence-specific, and that mutations in the vicinity or within the proto-spacer adjacent motif (PAM) allow plasmids to escape CRISPR-encoded immunity. We also establish that cas9 is the sole cas gene necessary for CRISPR-encoded interference. Furthermore, mutation analysis revealed that interference relies on the Cas9 McrA/HNH- and RuvC/RNaseH-motifs. Altogether, our results show that active CRISPR/Cas systems can be transferred across distant genera and provide heterologous interference against invasive nucleic acids. This can be leveraged to develop strains more robust against phage attack, and safer organisms less likely to uptake and disseminate plasmid-encoded undesirable genetic elements.},

Several recent interaction mapping studies have demonstrated the power of differential analysis for elucidating fundamental biological responses, revealing that the architecture of an interactome can be massively re-wired during a cellular or adaptive response. Here, we review the technological developments and experimental designs that have enabled differential network mapping at very large scales and highlight biological insight that has been derived from this type of analysis. We argue that differential network mapping, which allows for the interrogation of previously unexplored interaction spaces, will become a standard mode of network analysis in the future, just as differential gene expression and protein phosphorylation studies are already pervasive in genomic and proteomic analysis.},

Here we use yeast, mammalian cell lines and Xenopus laevis egg extracts to show that Top1 poisons rapidly induce replication-fork slowing and reversal, which can be uncoupled from DSB formation at sublethal inhibitor doses. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity, but not single-stranded break repair in general, is required for effective fork reversal and limits DSB formation. These data identify fork reversal as a means to prevent chromosome breakage upon exogenous replication stress and implicate proteins involved in fork reversal or restart as factors modulating the cytotoxicity of replication stress-inducing chemotherapeutics.},

At sites complementary to the crRNA-guide sequence, the Cas9 HNH nuclease domain cleaves the complementary strand, whereas the Cas9 RuvC-like domain cleaves the noncomplementary strand. The dual-tracrRNA:crRNA, when engineered as a single RNA chimera, also directs sequence-specific Cas9 dsDNA cleavage. Our study reveals a family of endonucleases that use dual-RNAs for site-specific DNA cleavage and highlights the potential to exploit the system for RNA-programmable genome editing.},

The cellular response to this compound elicits very diverse processes including DNA damage response and repair. Because an inorganic form of Se, sodium selenite (SeL), has often been a part of numerous studies and because this form of Se is used as a dietary supplement by the public, here, we elucidated mechanisms of SeL-induced toxicity in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a combination of systematic genetic and transcriptome analysis. First, we screened the yeast haploid deletion mutant library for growth in the presence of this Se compound. We identified 39 highly SeL sensitive mutants. The corresponding deleted genes encoded mostly proteins involved in DNA damage response and repair, vacuole function, glutathione (GSH) metabolism, transcription, and chromatin metabolism. DNA damage response and repair mutants were examined in more detail: a synergistic interaction between postreplication (PRR) and homologous recombination (HRR) repair pathways was revealed. In addition, the effect of combined defects in HRR and GSH metabolism was analyzed, and again, the synergistic interaction was found. Second, microarray analysis was used to reveal expression profile changes after SeL exposure. The gene process categories {"}amino acid metabolism{"} and {"}generation of precursor metabolites and energy{"} comprised the greatest number of induced and repressed genes, respectively. We propose that SeL-induced toxicity markedly results from DNA injury, thereby highlighting the importance of DNA damage response and repair pathways in protecting cells against toxic effects of this Se compound. In addition, we suggest that SeL toxicity also originates from damage to cellular proteins, including those acting in DNA damage response and repair.},

Classification of proteins by subcellular destination enables the identification of pathways that respond to replication stress. We analysed pairwise combinations of GFP fusions and gene deletion mutants to define and order two previously unknown DNA damage responses. In the first, Cmr1 forms subnuclear foci that are regulated by the histone deacetylase Hos2 and are distinct from the typical Rad52 repair foci. In a second example, we find that the checkpoint kinases Mec1/Tel1 and the translation regulator Asc1 regulate P-body formation.

  abstract = {Ten percent of inherited diseases are caused by premature termination codon (PTC) mutations that lead to degradation of the mRNA template and to the production of a non-functional, truncated polypeptide. In addition, many acquired mutations in cancer introduce similar PTCs. In 1999, proof-of-concept for treating these disorders was obtained in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy, when administration of aminoglycosides restored protein translation by inducing the ribosome to bypass a PTC. Since, many studies have validated this approach, but despite the promise of PTC readthrough therapies, the mechanisms of translation termination remain to be precisely elucidated before even more progress can be made. Here, we review the molecular basis for PTC readthrough in eukaryotes and describe currently available compounds with significant therapeutic potential for treating genetic disorders and cancer.},

Therapeutic strategies involving readthrough induction partially restore expression of proteins with normal function from nonsense-mutated genes, and small molecules such as aminoglycosides and PTC124 have exhibited promising results for treating patients with cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Transgenic expression of suppressor-tRNAs and depleting translation termination factors are, among others, potential strategies for treating PTC-associated diseases. In this review, the potential of using readthrough strategies as a therapy for cancer syndromes is discussed, and we consider the effect of nonsense-mediated decay and other factors on readthrough efficiency.},

  abstract = {The success of cisplatin (CP) based therapy is often hindered by acquisition of CP resistance. We isolated NSC109268 as a compound altering cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. Previous investigation revealed an enhancement of CP sensitivity by NSC109268 in wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae and CP-sensitive and -resistant cancer cell lines that correlated with a slower S phase traversal. Here, we extended these studies to determine the target pathway(s) of NSC109268 in mediating CP sensitization, using yeast as a model. We reasoned that mutants defective in the relevant target of NSC109268 should be hypersensitive to CP and the sensitization effect by NSC109268 should be absent or strongly reduced. A survey of various yeast deletion mutants converged on the Rad5 pathway of DNA damage tolerance by template switching as the likely target pathway of NSC109268 in mediating cellular sensitization to CP. Additionally, cell cycle delays following CP treatment were not synergistically influenced by NSC109268 in the CP hypersensitive rad5Δ mutant. The involvement of the known inhibitory activities of NSC109268 on 20S proteasome and phosphatases 2Cα and 2A was tested. In the CP hypersensitive ptc2Δptc3Δpph3Δ yeast strain, deficient for 2C and 2A-type phosphatases, cellular sensitization to CP by NSC109268 was greatly reduced. It is therefore suggested that NSC109268 affects CP sensitivity by inhibiting the activity of unknown protein(s) whose dephosphorylation is required for the template switch pathway. },

  abstract = {This work was designed to identify yeast cellular functions specifically affected by the stress factors predominating during the early stages of wine fermentation, and genes required for optimal growth under these conditions. The main experimental method was quantitative fitness analysis by means of competition experiments in continuous culture of whole genome barcoded yeast knockout collections. This methodology allowed the identification of haploinsufficient genes, and homozygous deletions resulting in growth impairment in synthetic must. However, genes identified as haploproficient, or homozygous deletions resulting in fitness advantage, were of little predictive power concerning optimal growth in this medium. The relevance of these functions for enological performance of yeast was assessed in batch cultures with single strains. Previous studies addressing yeast adaptation to winemaking conditions by quantitative fitness analysis were not specifically focused on the proliferative stages. In some instances our results highlight the importance of genes not previously linked to winemaking. In other cases they are complementary to those reported in previous studies concerning, for example, the relevance of some genes involved in vacuolar, peroxisomal, or ribosomal functions. Our results indicate that adaptation to the quickly changing growth conditions during grape must fermentation require the function of different gene sets in different moments of the process. Transport processes and glucose signaling seem to be negatively affected by the stress factors encountered by yeast in synthetic must. Vacuolar activity is important for continued growth during the transition to stationary phase. Finally, reduced biogenesis of peroxisomes also seems to be advantageous. However, in contrast to what was described for later stages, reduced protein synthesis is not advantageous for the early (proliferative) stages of the fermentation process. Finally, we found adenine and lysine to be in short supply for yeast growth in some natural grape musts. },

  abstract = {8-oxoG is one of the most common and mutagenic DNA base lesions caused by oxidative damage. However, it has not been possible to study the replication of a known 8-oxoG base in vivo in order to determine the accuracy of its replication, the influence of various components on that accuracy, and the extent to which an 8-oxoG might present a barrier to replication. We have been able to place a single 8-oxoG into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome in a defined location using single-strand oligonucleotide transformation and to study its replication in a fully normal chromosome context. During replication, 8-oxoG is recognized as a lesion and triggers a switch to translesion synthesis by Pol η, which replicates 8-oxoG with an accuracy (insertion of a C opposite the 8-oxoG) of approximately 94%. In the absence of Pol η, template switching to the newly synthesized sister chromatid is observed at least one third of the time; replication of the 8-oxoG in the absence of Pol η is less than 40% accurate. The mismatch repair (MMR) system plays an important role in 8-oxoG replication. Template switching is blocked by MMR and replication accuracy even in the absence of Pol η is approximately 95% when MMR is active. These findings indicate that in light of the overlapping mechanisms by which errors in 8-oxoG replication can be avoided in the cell, the mutagenic threat of 8-oxoG is due more to its abundance than the effect of a single lesion. In addition, the methods used here should be applicable to the study of any lesion that can be stably incorporated into synthetic oligonucleotides. },

  abstract = {DNA damage tolerance consisting of template switching and translesion synthesis is a major cellular mechanism in response to unrepaired DNA lesions during replication. The Rev1 pathway constitutes the major mechanism of translesion synthesis and base damage-induced mutagenesis in model cell systems. Rev1 is a dCMP transferase, but additionally plays non-catalytic functions in translesion synthesis. Using the yeast model system, we attempted to gain further insights into the non-catalytic functions of Rev1. Rev1 stably interacts with Rad5 (a central component of the template switching pathway) via the C-terminal region of Rev1 and the N-terminal region of Rad5. Supporting functional significance of this interaction, both the Rev1 pathway and Rad5 are required for translesion synthesis and mutagenesis of 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine. Furthermore, disrupting the Rev1-Rad5 interaction by mutating Rev1 did not affect its dCMP transferase, but led to inactivation of the Rev1 non-catalytic function in translesion synthesis of UV-induced DNA damage. Deletion analysis revealed that the C-terminal 21-amino acid sequence of Rev1 is uniquely required for its interaction with Rad5 and is essential for its non-catalytic function. Deletion analysis additionally implicated a C-terminal region of Rev1 in its negative regulation. These results show that a non-catalytic function of Rev1 in translesion synthesis and mutagenesis is mediated by its interaction with Rad5.},

  abstract = {Germ line mutations in breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) predispose women to breast and ovarian cancers. Although BRCA1 is involved in many important biological processes, the function of BRCA1 in homologous recombination (HR) mediated repair is considered one of the major mechanisms contributing to its tumor suppression activity, and the cause of hypersensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors when BRCA1 is defective. Mounting evidence suggests that the mechanism of repairing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) by HR is different than the mechanism operating when DNA replication is blocked. Although BRCA1 has been recognized as a central component in HR, the precise role of BRCA1 in HR, particularly under replication stress, has remained largely unknown. Given the fact that DNA lesions caused by replication blockages are the primary substrates for HR in mitotic cells, functional analysis of BRCA1 in HR repair in the context of replication stress should benefit our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis associated with BRCA1 deficiencies, as well as the development of therapeutic approaches for cancer patients carrying BRCA1 mutations or reduced BRCA1 expression. This review focuses on the current advances in this setting and also discusses the significance in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy.},

  abstract = {Platinum compounds are the foundation of chemotherapy regimens for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) despite poor response rates and limited response duration. It has been reported that tumor expression of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), a key component in nucleotide excision repair, may correlate with clinical response to platinum agents. We found that most primary lung tumor specimens demonstrated a stronger protein expression of poly (adenosine diphosphate ribose) polymerases 1 (PARP1) than their normal counterparts. Therefore, we hypothesized that combining PARP inhibition with platinum compounds may be an approach to improve platinum-based therapy for NSCLC. Drug combination experiments revealed that two distinct PARP inhibitors, olaparib and veliparib, not only potentiated the cell killing by cisplatin but also conferred cytotoxicity as a single agent specifically in ERCC1-low HCC827 and PC9 but not in ERCC1-high A549 and H157 lung cancer cells. Moreover, small interfering RNA knockdown of ERCC1 in A549 and H157 cells increased their sensitivities to both cisplatin and olaparib in a synergistic manner in our model. Furthermore, mechanistic studies indicated that combined PARP inhibitor and cisplatin could lead to sustained DNA double-strand breaks, prolonged G2/M cell cycle arrest with distinct activation of checkpoint kinase 1 signaling and more pronounced apoptosis preferentially in lung cancer cells with low ERCC1 expression. Collectively, these data suggest that there is a synergistic relationship between PARP inhibition and low ERCC1 expression in NSCLC that could be exploited for novel therapeutic approaches in lung cancer therapy based on tumor ERCC1 expression.},

  abstract = {AIM: Thymidine deprivation is a common cancer treatment. This study examines the role of replication arrest and uracil DNA repair in response to thymidine deprivation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Strains of S. cerevisiae deficient in various replication and DNA repair functions were tested for sensitivity to thymidine deprivation induced by the antifolate aminopterin. Cell survival and DNA content were assayed following drug treatment.
RESULTS: Most arrest mutants were more sensitive to aminopterin than was the parental strain. Inactivation of uracil glycosylase in arrest mutants led to a partial reduction in toxicity for some double-mutants. DNA content during exposure to aminopterin was similar in parental and single mutants. However, cells deficient in both arrest and uracil glycosylase functions exhibited continued DNA synthesis, suggesting that uracil glycosylase activity contributes to replication arrest during thymidine deprivation.
CONCLUSION: Replication arrest and uracil DNA repair are important and overlapping determinants of cellular response to thymidine deprivation.},

  abstract = {The DNA damage response kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) coordinates much of the cellular response to replication stress. The exact mechanisms by which ATR regulates DNA synthesis in conditions of replication stress are largely unknown, but this activity is critical for the viability and proliferation of cancer cells, making ATR a potential therapeutic target. Here we use selective ATR inhibitors to demonstrate that acute inhibition of ATR kinase activity yields rapid cell lethality, disrupts the timing of replication initiation, slows replication elongation, and induces fork collapse. We define the mechanism of this fork collapse, which includes SLX4-dependent cleavage yielding double-strand breaks and CtIP-dependent resection generating excess single-stranded template and nascent DNA strands. Our data suggest that the DNA substrates of these nucleases are generated at least in part by the SMARCAL1 DNA translocase. Properly regulated SMARCAL1 promotes stalled fork repair and restart; however, unregulated SMARCAL1 contributes to fork collapse when ATR is inactivated in both mammalian and Xenopus systems. ATR phosphorylates SMARCAL1 on S652, thereby limiting its fork regression activities and preventing aberrant fork processing. Thus, phosphorylation of SMARCAL1 is one mechanism by which ATR prevents fork collapse, promotes the completion of DNA replication, and maintains genome integrity. },

These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour-normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour-normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer. },

The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, 'kataegis', is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy. },

This analysis enabled functional assignment of RNAPII subdomains and uncovered connections between individual regions and other protein complexes. Using splicing microarrays and mutants that alter elongation rates in vitro, we found an inverse relationship between RNAPII speed and in vivo splicing efficiency. Furthermore, the pE-MAP classified fast and slow mutants that favor upstream and downstream start site selection, respectively. The striking coordination of polymerization rate with transcription initiation and splicing suggests that transcription rate is tuned to regulate multiple gene expression steps.

  abstract = {The repair of chromosomal double strand breaks (DSBs) is crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity. However, the repair of DSBs can also destabilize the genome by causing mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, the driving forces for carcinogenesis and hereditary diseases. Break-induced replication (BIR) is one of the DSB repair pathways that is highly prone to genetic instability. BIR proceeds by invasion of one broken end into a homologous DNA sequence followed by replication that can copy hundreds of kilobases of DNA from a donor molecule all the way through its telomere. The resulting repaired chromosome comes at a great cost to the cell, as BIR promotes mutagenesis, loss of heterozygosity, translocations, and copy number variations, all hallmarks of carcinogenesis. BIR uses most known replication proteins to copy large portions of DNA, similar to S-phase replication. It has therefore been suggested that BIR proceeds by semiconservative replication; however, the model of a bona fide, stable replication fork contradicts the known instabilities associated with BIR such as a 1,000-fold increase in mutation rate compared to normal replication. Here we demonstrate that in budding yeast the mechanism of replication during BIR is significantly different from S-phase replication, as it proceeds via an unusual bubble-like replication fork that results in conservative inheritance of the new genetic material. We provide evidence that this atypical mode of DNA replication, dependent on Pif1 helicase, is responsible for the marked increase in BIR-associated mutations. We propose that the BIR mode of synthesis presents a powerful mechanism that can initiate bursts of genetic instability in eukaryotes, including humans. },

  abstract = {During DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR), DNA synthesis copies information from a template DNA molecule. Multiple DNA polymerases have been implicated in repair-specific DNA synthesis, but it has remained unclear whether a DNA helicase is involved in this reaction. A good candidate DNA helicase is Pif1, an evolutionarily conserved helicase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae important for break-induced replication (BIR) as well as HR-dependent telomere maintenance in the absence of telomerase found in 10-15% of all cancers. Pif1 has a role in DNA synthesis across hard-to-replicate sites and in lagging-strand synthesis with polymerase δ (Polδ). Here we provide evidence that Pif1 stimulates DNA synthesis during BIR and crossover recombination. The initial steps of BIR occur normally in Pif1-deficient cells, but Polδ recruitment and DNA synthesis are decreased, resulting in premature resolution of DNA intermediates into half-crossovers. Purified Pif1 protein strongly stimulates Polδ-mediated DNA synthesis from a D-loop made by the Rad51 recombinase. Notably, Pif1 liberates the newly synthesized strand to prevent the accumulation of topological constraint and to facilitate extensive DNA synthesis via the establishment of a migrating D-loop structure. Our results uncover a novel function of Pif1 and provide insights into the mechanism of HR. },

Though many RNAi screens report on the identification of genes, very few, if any, have been further studied and validated. Data discrepancy is emerging as one of RNAi main pitfalls. We reasoned that a systematic analysis of lethality-based screens, since they score for cell death, would examine the extent of hit discordance at inter-screen level. To this end, we developed a methodology for literature mining and overlap analysis of several screens using both siRNA and shRNA flavors, and obtained 64 gene lists censoring an initial list of 7,430 nominated genes. We further performed a comparative analysis first at a global level followed by hit re-assessment under much more stringent conditions. To our surprise, none of the hits overlapped across the board even for PLK1, which emerged as a strong candidate in siRNA screens; but only marginally in the shRNA ones. Furthermore, EIF5B emerges as the most common hit only in the shRNA screens. A highly unusual and unprecedented result was the observation that 5,269 out of 6,664 nominated genes (~80%) in the shRNA screens were exclusive to the pooled format, raising concerns as to the merits of pooled screens which qualify hits based on relative depletions, possibly due to multiple integrations per cell, data deconvolution or inaccuracies in intracellular processing causing off-target effects. Without golden standards in place, we would encourage the community to pay more attention to RNAi screening data analysis practices, bearing in mind that it is combinatorial in nature and one active siRNA duplex or shRNA hairpin per gene does not suffice credible hit nomination. Finally, we also would like to caution interpretation of pooled shRNA screening outcomes. },

Integrating our driver predictions with information on somatic copy number alterations, we find that the distribution and potency of TSGs (STOP genes), OGs, and essential genes (GO genes) on chromosomes can predict the complex patterns of aneuploidy and copy number variation characteristic of cancer genomes.

Integration of genetic data with physical interaction networks identified a global map of 89 UV-induced functional interactions among 62 protein complexes, including a number of links between the RSC complex and several NER factors. We show that RSC is recruited to both silenced and transcribed loci following UV damage where it facilitates efficient repair by promoting nucleosome remodeling. Finally, a comparison of the response to high versus low levels of UV shows that the degree of genetic rewiring correlates with dose of UV and reveals a network of dose-specific interactions.

The literature supporting these variable roles is controversial, and it has been debated whether Mcm10 has an active role in elongation. Here, we provide evidence that the mcm10-1 allele confers alterations in DNA synthesis that lead to defective-replisome-induced mutagenesis (DRIM). Specifically, we observed that mcm10-1 cells exhibited elevated levels of PCNA ubiquitination and activation of the translesion polymerase, pol-ζ. Whereas translesion synthesis had no measurable impact on viability, mcm10-1 mutants also engaged in error-free postreplicative repair (PRR), and this pathway promoted survival at semi-permissive conditions. Replication gaps in mcm10-1 were likely caused by elongation defects, as dbf4-1 mutants, which are compromised for origin activation did not display any hallmarks of replication stress. Furthermore, we demonstrate that deficiencies in priming, induced by a pol1-1 mutation, also resulted in DRIM, but not in error-free PRR. Similar to mcm10-1 mutants, DRIM did not rescue the replication defect in pol1-1 cells. Thus, it appears that DRIM is not proficient to fill replication gaps in pol1-1 and mcm10-1 mutants. Moreover, the ability to correctly prime nascent DNA may be a crucial prerequisite to initiate error-free PRR. },

The replication structures are stabilized in vivo (by psoralen cross-linking) prior to extraction and enrichment procedures, allowing their visualization at the transmission electron microscope. This chapter outlines the procedures required to visualize and interpret in vivo replication intermediates of genomic DNA, extracted from budding yeast, Xenopus egg extracts, or cultured mammalian cells. },

It can deal with very large numbers (many tens of thousands) of DNA/RNA or protein sequences due to its use of the mBED algorithm for calculating guide trees. This algorithm allows very large alignment problems to be tackled very quickly, even on personal computers. The accuracy of the program has been considerably improved over earlier Clustal programs, through the use of the HHalign method for aligning profile hidden Markov models.

  abstract = {RNA-guided endonucleases (RGENs), derived from the prokaryotic adaptive immune system known as CRISPR/Cas, enable targeted genome engineering in cells and organisms. RGENs are ribonucleoproteins that consist of guide RNA and Cas9, a protein component originated from Streptococcus pyogenes. These enzymes cleave chromosomal DNA, whose sequence is complementary, to guide RNA in a targeted manner, producing site-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), the repair of which gives rise to targeted genome modifications. Despite broad interest in RGEN-mediated genome editing, these nucleases are limited by off-target mutations and unwanted chromosomal translocations associated with off-target DNA cleavages. Here, we show that off-target effects of RGENs can be reduced below the detection limits of deep sequencing by choosing unique target sequences in the genome and modifying both guide RNA and Cas9. We found that both the composition and structure of guide RNA can affect RGEN activities in cells to reduce off-target effects. RGENs efficiently discriminated on-target sites from off-target sites that differ by two bases. Furthermore, exome sequencing analysis showed that no off-target mutations were induced by two RGENs in four clonal populations of mutant cells. In addition, paired Cas9 nickases, composed of D10A Cas9 and guide RNA, which generate two single-strand breaks (SSBs) or nicks on different DNA strands, were highly specific in human cells, avoiding off-target mutations without sacrificing genome-editing efficiency. Interestingly, paired nickases induced chromosomal deletions in a targeted manner without causing unwanted translocations. Our results highlight the importance of choosing unique target sequences and optimizing guide RNA and Cas9 to avoid or reduce RGEN-induced off-target mutations. },

  abstract = {Stalling of replication forks at unrepaired DNA lesions can result in discontinuities opposite the damage in the newly synthesized DNA strand. Translesion synthesis or facilitating the copy from the newly synthesized strand of the sister duplex by template switching can overcome such discontinuities. During template switch, a new primer-template junction has to be formed and two mechanisms, including replication fork reversal and D-loop formation have been suggested. Genetic evidence indicates a major role for yeast Rad5 in template switch and that both Rad5 and its human orthologue, Helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF), a potential tumour suppressor can facilitate replication fork reversal. This study demonstrates the ability of HLTF and Rad5 to form a D-loop without requiring ATP binding and/or hydrolysis. We also show that this strand-pairing activity is independent of RAD51 in vitro and is not mechanistically related to that of another member of the SWI/SNF family, RAD54. In addition, the 3'-end of the invading strand in the D-loop can serve as a primer and is extended by DNA polymerase. Our data indicate that HLTF is involved in a RAD51-independent D-loop branch of template switch pathway that can promote repair of gaps formed during replication of damaged DNA. },

  abstract = {DNA post-replication repair (PRR) functions to bypass replication-blocking lesions and is subdivided into two parallel pathways: error-prone translesion DNA synthesis and error-free PRR. While both pathways are dependent on the ubiquitination of PCNA, error-free PRR utilizes noncanonical K63-linked polyubiquitinated PCNA to signal lesion bypass through template switch, a process thought to be dependent on Mms2-Ubc13 and a RING finger motif of the Rad5 ubiquitin ligase. Previous in vitro studies demonstrated the ability of Rad5 to promote replication fork regression, a function dependent on its helicase activity. To investigate the genetic and mechanistic relationship between fork regression in vitro and template switch in vivo, we created and characterized site-specific mutations defective in the Rad5 RING or helicase activity. Our results indicate that both the Rad5 ubiquitin ligase and the helicase activities are exclusively involved in the same error-free PRR pathway. Surprisingly, the Rad5 helicase mutation abolishes its physical interaction with Ubc13 and the K63-linked PCNA polyubiquitin chain assembly. Indeed, physical fusions of Rad5 with Ubc13 bypass the requirement for either the helicase or the RING finger domain. Since the helicase domain overlaps with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling domain, our findings suggest a structural role of this domain and that the Rad5 helicase activity is dispensable for error-free lesion bypass. },

  abstract = {In the absence of telomerase, telomeres progressively shorten with every round of DNA replication, leading to replicative senescence. In telomerase-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the shortest telomere triggers the onset of senescence by activating the DNA damage checkpoint and recruiting homologous recombination (HR) factors. Yet, the molecular structures that trigger this checkpoint and the mechanisms of repair have remained elusive. By tracking individual telomeres, we show that telomeres are subjected to different pathways depending on their length. We first demonstrate a progressive accumulation of subtelomeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) through 5'-3' resection as telomeres shorten. Thus, exposure of subtelomeric ssDNA could be the signal for cell cycle arrest in senescence. Strikingly, early after loss of telomerase, HR counteracts subtelomeric ssDNA accumulation rather than elongates telomeres. We then asked whether replication repair pathways contribute to this mechanism. We uncovered that Rad5, a DNA helicase/Ubiquitin ligase of the error-free branch of the DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathway, associates with native telomeres and cooperates with HR in senescent cells. We propose that DDT acts in a length-independent manner, whereas an HR-based repair using the sister chromatid as a template buffers precocious 5'-3' resection at the shortest telomeres. },

Prior studies have suggested that specific H3K79 methylation states play distinct roles in the response to UV-induced DNA damage. To evaluate these observations, we examined the effect of altered H3K79 methylation patterns on UV-induced G1/S checkpoint response and sister chromatid exchange (SCE). We found that the di- and trimethylated states both contribute to activation of the G1/S checkpoint to varying degrees, depending on the synchronization method, although methylation is not required for checkpoint in response to high levels of UV damage. In contrast, UV-induced SCE is largely a product of the trimethylated state, which influences the usage of gene conversion versus popout mechanisms. Regulation of H3K79 methylation by H2BK123 ubiquitylation is important for both checkpoint function and SCE. H3K79 methylation is not required for the repair of double-stranded breaks caused by transient HO endonuclease expression, but does play a modest role in survival from continuous exposure. The overall results provide evidence for the participation of H3K79 methylation in UV-induced recombination repair and checkpoint activation, and further indicate that the di- and trimethylation states play distinct roles in these DNA damage response pathways. },

However, tumors rely on residual DNA repair capacities to survive the damage induced by genotoxic stress. This dichotomy might explain why only isolated DNA repair pathways are inactivated in cancer cells. Accordingly, synergism has been observed between DNA-damaging drugs and targeted inhibitors of DNA repair. DNA repair pathways are generally thought of as mutually exclusive mechanistic units handling different types of lesions in distinct cell cycle phases. Recent preclinical studies, however, provide strong evidence that multifunctional DNA repair hubs, which are involved in multiple conventional DNA repair pathways, are frequently altered in cancer. We therefore propose that targeted anticancer therapies should not only exploit synthetic lethal interactions between two single genes but also consider alterations in DNA repair hubs. Such a network-based approach considerably increases the opportunities for targeting DNA repair-defective tumors. },

  abstract = {Breakpoint junctions of the chromosomal translocations that occur in human cancers display hallmarks of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). In mouse cells, translocations are suppressed by canonical NHEJ (c-NHEJ) components, which include DNA ligase IV (LIG4), and instead arise from alternative NHEJ (alt-NHEJ). Here we used designer nucleases (ZFNs, TALENs, and CRISPR/Cas9) to introduce DSBs on two chromosomes to study translocation joining mechanisms in human cells. Remarkably, translocations were altered in cells deficient for LIG4 or its interacting protein XRCC4. Translocation junctions had significantly longer deletions and more microhomology, indicative of alt-NHEJ. Thus, unlike mouse cells, translocations in human cells are generated by c-NHEJ. Human cancer translocations induced by paired Cas9 nicks also showed a dependence on c-NHEJ, despite having distinct joining characteristics. These results demonstrate an unexpected and striking species-specific difference for common genomic rearrangements associated with tumorigenesis. },

  abstract = {CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeats are unstable, fragile sequences that strongly position nucleosomes, but little is known about chromatin modifications required to prevent genomic instability at these or other structure-forming sequences. We discovered that regulated histone H4 acetylation is required to maintain CAG repeat stability and promote gap-induced sister chromatid recombination. CAG expansions in the absence of H4 HATs NuA4 and Hat1 and HDACs Sir2, Hos2, and Hst1 depended on Rad52, Rad57, and Rad5 and were therefore arising through homology-mediated postreplication repair (PRR) events. H4K12 and H4K16 acetylation were required to prevent Rad5-dependent CAG repeat expansions, and H4K16 acetylation was enriched at CAG repeats during S phase. Genetic experiments placed the RSC chromatin remodeler in the same PRR pathway, and Rsc2 recruitment was coincident with H4K16 acetylation. Here we have utilized a repetitive DNA sequence that induces endogenous DNA damage to identify histone modifications that regulate recombination efficiency and fidelity during postreplication gap repair.},

Here we show that Uls1 is implicated in DNA repair independently of the replication stress response pathways mediated by the endonucleases Mus81 and Yen1 and the helicases Mph1 and Srs2. Uls1 works together with Sgs1 and we demonstrate that the attenuation of replication stress-related defects in sgs1Δ by deletion of ULS1 depends on a functional of Rad51 recombinase and post-replication repair pathway mediated by Rad18 and Rad5, but not on the translesion polymerase, Rev3. The higher resistance of sgs1Δ uls1Δ mutants to genotoxic stress compared to single sgs1Δ cells is not the result of decreased formation or accelerated resolution of recombination-dependent DNA structures. Instead, deletion of ULS1 restores stability of the rDNA region in sgs1Δ cells. Our data suggest that Uls1 may contribute to genomic stability during DNA synthesis and channel the repair of replication lesions into the Sgs1-dependent pathway, with DNA translocase and SUMO binding activities of Uls1 as well as a RING domain being essential for its functions in replication stress response. },

  abstract = {Psoralen photoreaction produces covalent monoadducts and interstrand crosslinks in DNA. The interstrand DNA crosslinks are complex double strand lesions that require the involvement of multiple pathways for repair. Homologous recombination, which can carry out error-free repair, is a major pathway for crosslink repair; however, some recombination pathways can also produce DNA rearrangements. Psoralen photoreaction-induced recombination in yeast was measured using direct repeat substrates that can detect gene conversions, a form of conservative recombination, as well as deletions and triplications, which generate gene copy number changes. In repair-proficient cells the major products of recombination were gene conversions, along with substantial fractions of deletions. Deficiencies in DNA repair pathways increased non-conservative recombination products. Homologous recombination-deficient rad51, rad54, and rad57 strains had low levels of crosslink-induced recombination, and most products were deletions produced by single strand annealing. Nucleotide excision repair-deficient rad1 and rad2 yeast had increased levels of triplications, and rad1 cells had lower crosslink-induced recombination. Deficiencies in post-replication repair increased crosslink-induced recombination and gene copy number changes. Loss of REV3 function, in the error-prone branch, and of RAD5 and UBC13, in the error-free branch, produced moderate increases in deletions and triplications; rad18 cells, deficient in both post-replication repair sub-pathways, exhibited hyperrecombination, with primarily non-conservative products. Proper functioning of all the DNA repair pathways tested was required to maintain genomic stability and avoid gene copy number variation in response to interstrand crosslinks. },

  abstract = {Cisplatin, cisplatinum, or cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II), is a well-known chemotherapeutic drug. It has been used for treatment of numerous human cancers including bladder, head and neck, lung, ovarian, and testicular cancers. It is effective against various types of cancers, including carcinomas, germ cell tumors, lymphomas, and sarcomas. Its mode of action has been linked to its ability to crosslink with the purine bases on the DNA; interfering with DNA repair mechanisms, causing DNA damage, and subsequently inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. However, because of drug resistance and numerous undesirable side effects such as severe kidney problems, allergic reactions, decrease immunity to infections, gastrointestinal disorders, hemorrhage, and hearing loss especially in younger patients, other platinum-containing anti-cancer drugs such as carboplatin, oxaliplatin and others, have also been used. Furthermore, combination therapies of cisplatin with other drugs have been highly considered to overcome drug-resistance and reduce toxicity. This comprehensive review highlights the physicochemical properties of cisplatin and related platinum-based drugs, and discusses its uses (either alone or in combination with other drugs) for the treatment of various human cancers. A special attention is paid to its molecular mechanisms of action, and its undesirable side effects. },

We show here that Fun30 also contributes to cellular resistance to genotoxins methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and hydroxyurea (HU) that can stall the progression of DNA replication. We present evidence implicating DNA end resection in Fun30-dependent MMS-resistance. On the other hand, we show that Fun30 deletion suppresses the MMS- and HU-sensitivity of cells lacking the Rad5/Mms2/Ubc13-dependent error-free DNA damage tolerance mechanism. This suppression is not the result of a reduction in DNA end resection, and is dependent on the key HR component Rad51. We further show that Fun30 negatively regulates the recovery of rad5Δ mutant from MMS induced G2/M arrest. Therefore, Fun30 has two functions in DNA damage repair: one is the promotion of cellular resistance to genotoxic stress by aiding in DNA end resection, and the other is the negative regulation of a Rad51-dependent, DNA end resection-independent mechanism for countering replicative stress. The latter becomes manifest when Rad5 dependent DNA damage tolerance is impaired. In addition, we find that the putative ubiquitin-binding CUE domain of Fun30 serves to restrict the ability of Fun30 to hinder MMS- and HU-tolerance in the absence of Rad5. },

Already there are promising indications, from clinical trials exploiting this concept by using poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in patients with germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations, that this approach could be beneficial. We discuss the biological rationale for BRCA-PARP synthetic lethality, how the synthetic lethal approach is being assessed in the clinic, and how mechanisms of resistance are starting to be dissected. Applying the synthetic lethal concept to target non-BRCA-mutant cancers also has clear potential, and we discuss how some of the principles learned in developing PARP inhibitors might also drive the development of additional genetic approaches. },

  abstract = {ELG1 is a conserved gene with important roles in the maintenance of genome stability. Elg1's activity prevents gross chromosomal rearrangements, maintains proper telomere length regulation, helps repairing DNA damage created by a number of genotoxins and participates in sister chromatid cohesion. Elg1 is evolutionarily conserved, and its Fanconi Anemia-related mammalian ortholog (also known as ATAD5) is embryonic lethal when lost in mice and acts as a tumor suppressor in mice and humans. Elg1 encodes a protein that forms an RFC-like complex that unloads the replicative clamp, PCNA, from DNA, mainly in its SUMOylated form. We have identified 2 different regions in yeast Elg1 that undergo phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of one of them, S112, is dependent on the ATR yeast ortholog, Mec1, and probably is a direct target of this kinase. We show that phosphorylation of Elg1 is important for its role at telomeres. Mutants unable to undergo phosphorylation suppress the DNA damage sensitivity of Δrad5 mutants, defective for an error-free post-replicational bypass pathway. This indicates a role of phosphorylation in the regulation of DNA repair. Our results open the way to investigate the mechanisms by which the activity of Elg1 is regulated during DNA replication and in response to DNA damage. },

To emphasize depth of knowledge on known cancer genes, mutation information is curated manually from the scientific literature, allowing very precise definitions of disease types and patient details. Combination of almost 20,000 published studies gives substantial resolution of how mutations and phenotypes relate in human cancer, providing insights into the stratification of mutations and biomarkers across cancer patient populations. Conversely, our curation of cancer genomes (over 12,000) emphasizes knowledge breadth, driving discovery of unrecognized cancer-driving hotspots and molecular targets. Our high-resolution curation approach is globally unique, giving substantial insight into molecular biomarkers in human oncology. In addition, COSMIC also details more than six million noncoding mutations, 10,534 gene fusions, 61,299 genome rearrangements, 695,504 abnormal copy number segments and 60,119,787 abnormal expression variants. All these types of somatic mutation are annotated to both the human genome and each affected coding gene, then correlated across disease and mutation types.},

HTGTS with different Cas9:sgRNA or TALEN nucleases revealed off-target hotspot numbers for given nucleases that ranged from a few or none to dozens or more, and extended the number of known off-targets for certain previously characterized nucleases more than tenfold. We also identified translocations between bona fide nuclease targets on homologous chromosomes, an undesired collateral effect that has not been described previously. Finally, HTGTS confirmed that the Cas9D10A paired nickase approach suppresses off-target cleavage genome-wide. },

  abstract = {Many genome maintenance factors have multiple enzymatic activities. In most cases, how their distinct activities functionally relate with each other is unclear. Here we examined the conserved budding yeast Rad5 protein that has both ubiquitin ligase and DNA helicase activities. The Rad5 ubiquitin ligase activity mediates PCNA poly-ubiquitination and subsequently recombination-based DNA lesion tolerance. Interestingly, the ligase domain is embedded in a larger helicase domain comprising seven consensus motifs. How features of the helicase domain influence ligase function is controversial. To clarify this issue, we use genetic, 2D gel and biochemical analyses and show that a Rad5 helicase motif important for ATP binding is also required for PCNA poly-ubiquitination and recombination-based lesion tolerance. We determine that this requirement is due to a previously unrecognized contribution of the motif to the PCNA and ubiquitination enzyme interaction, and not due to its canonical role in supporting helicase activity. We further show that Rad5's helicase-mediated contribution to replication stress survival is separable from recombination. These findings delineate how two Rad5 enzymatic domains concertedly influence PCNA modification, and unveil their discrete contributions to stress tolerance. },

  abstract = {DNA-damage tolerance (DDT) is an important mechanism for living cells to bypass replication blocks on the template strand. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DDT is mediated by the RAD6 epistasis group of genes, consisting of two parallel pathways: error-prone translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), and error-free lesion bypass. The two pathways are activated by sequential ubiquitination of PCNA on the Lys164 residue. When a replication fork is stalled at a lesion, PCNA is first monoubiquitinated by Rad6-Rad18, which leads to the TLS pathway. The subsequent ubiquitination by the Mms2-Ubc13-Rad5 complex on the monoubiquitinated PCNA is to form a Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chain that promotes error-free lesion bypass. While the TLS pathway has been extensively characterized, the molecular events leading to error-free lesion bypass by polyubiquitinated PCNA are largely obscure. Furthermore, PCNA can also be sumoylated at the same Lys164 residue, which helps to recruit Srs2, a helicase and anti-recombinase. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of error-free DDT and its interplay with Srs2 and homologous recombination.},

Here, we present biochemical and structural evidence that the HIRAN domain, an ancient and conserved domain found in HLTF and other DNA processing proteins, is a modified oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide (OB) fold that binds to 3' ssDNA ends. We demonstrate that the HIRAN domain promotes HLTF-dependent fork reversal in vitro through its interaction with 3' ssDNA ends found at forks. Finally, we show that HLTF restrains replication fork progression in cells in a HIRAN-dependent manner.

As a result, it can often be difficult to target double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with the precision that is necessary for various genome-editing applications. The ability to engineer Cas9 derivatives with purposefully altered PAM specificities would address this limitation. Here we show that the commonly used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) can be modified to recognize alternative PAM sequences using structural information, bacterial selection-based directed evolution, and combinatorial design. These altered PAM specificity variants enable robust editing of endogenous gene sites in zebrafish and human cells not currently targetable by wild-type SpCas9, and their genome-wide specificities are comparable to wild-type SpCas9 as judged by GUIDE-seq analysis. In addition, we identify and characterize another SpCas9 variant that exhibits improved specificity in human cells, possessing better discrimination against off-target sites with non-canonical NAG and NGA PAMs and/or mismatched spacers. We also find that two smaller-size Cas9 orthologues, Streptococcus thermophilus Cas9 (St1Cas9) and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9), function efficiently in the bacterial selection systems and in human cells, suggesting that our engineering strategies could be extended to Cas9s from other species. Our findings provide broadly useful SpCas9 variants and, more importantly, establish the feasibility of engineering a wide range of Cas9s with altered and improved PAM specificities. },

Here, we show that interstitial Ytel repeats in the opposite C orientation prefer to expand rather than cause GCR. A tract of eight Ytel repeats expands at a rate of 4 × 10(-4) per replication, ranking them among the most expansion-prone DNA microsatellites.

The SGA signature of the K164R allele showed a striking correlation with profiles of mutants deficient in various aspects of lagging strand replication, including rad27Δ and elg1Δ. Rad27 is the primary flap endonuclease that processes 5' flaps generated during lagging strand replication, whereas Elg1 has been implicated in unloading PCNA from chromatin. We observed chronic ubiquitination of PCNA at K164 in both rad27Δ and elg1Δ mutants. Notably, only rad27Δ cells exhibited a decline in cell viability upon elimination of PRR pathways, whereas elg1Δ mutants were not affected. We further provide evidence that K164 ubiquitination suppresses replication stress resulting from defective flap processing during Okazaki fragment maturation. Accordingly, ablation of PCNA ubiquitination increased S phase checkpoint activation, indicated by hyperphosphorylation of the Rad53 kinase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alternative flap processing by overexpression of catalytically active exonuclease 1 eliminates PCNA ubiquitination. This suggests a model in which unprocessed flaps may directly participate in PRR signaling. Our findings demonstrate that PCNA ubiquitination at K164 in response to replication stress is not limited to DNA synthesis defects but extends to DNA processing during lagging strand replication. },

  abstract = {An underlying hallmark of cancers is their genomic instability, which is associated with a greater propensity to accumulate DNA damage. Historical treatment of cancer by radiotherapy and DNA-damaging chemotherapy is based on this principle, yet it is accompanied by significant collateral damage to normal tissue and unwanted side effects. Targeted therapy based on inhibiting the DNA damage response (DDR) in cancers offers the potential for a greater therapeutic window by tailoring treatment to patients with tumors lacking specific DDR functions. The recent approval of olaparib (Lynparza), the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor for treating tumors harboring BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, represents the first medicine based on this principle, exploiting an underlying cause of tumor formation that also represents an Achilles' heel. This review highlights the different concepts behind targeting DDR in cancer and how this can provide significant opportunities for DDR-based therapies in the future. },

Although longer PAMs can potentially improve the specificity of genome editing, they limit the range of sequences that Cas9 orthologs can target. One potential strategy to relieve this restriction is to relax the PAM recognition specificity of Cas9. Here we used molecular evolution to modify the NNGRRT PAM of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9). One variant we identified, referred to as KKH SaCas9, showed robust genome editing activities at endogenous human target sites with NNNRRT PAMs, thereby increasing SaCas9 targeting range by two- to fourfold. Using GUIDE-seq, we show that wild-type and KKH SaCas9 induce comparable numbers of off-target effects in human cells. Our strategy for evolving PAM specificity does not require structural information and therefore should be applicable to a wide range of Cas9 orthologs.},

Genetically encoding N-ɛ-acetyl-lysine in place of six lysine residues in histone H3 enables deposition of pre-acetylated histones into cellular chromatin, via a pathway that is orthogonal to enzymatic modification.

  abstract = {The accurate segregation of chromosomes during cell division is achieved by attachment of chromosomes to the mitotic spindle via the kinetochore, a large multi-protein complex that assembles on centromeres. The budding yeast kinetochore comprises more than 60 different proteins. Although the structure and function of many of these proteins has been investigated, we have little understanding of the steady state regulation of kinetochores. The primary model of kinetochore homeostasis suggests that kinetochores assemble hierarchically from the centromeric DNA via the inclusion of a centromere-specific histone into chromatin. We tested this model by trying to perturb kinetochore protein levels by overexpressing an outer kinetochore gene, MTW1. This increase in protein failed to change protein recruitment, consistent with the hierarchical assembly model. However, we find that deletion of Psh1, a key ubiquitin ligase that is known to restrict inner kinetochore protein loading, does not increase levels of outer kinetochore proteins, thus breaking the normal kinetochore stoichiometry. This perturbation leads to chromosome segregation defects, which can be partially suppressed by mutation of Ubr2, a second ubiquitin ligase that normally restricts protein levels at the outer kinetochore. Together these data show that Psh1 and Ubr2 synergistically control the amount of proteins at the kinetochore. },

  abstract = {Many cancer chemotherapy agents act by targeting the DNA of cancer cells, causing substantial damage within their genome and causing them to undergo apoptosis. An effective DNA repair pathway in cancer cells can act in a reverse way by removing these drug-induced DNA lesions, allowing cancer cells to survive, grow and proliferate. In this context, DNA repair inhibitors opened a new avenue in cancer treatment, by blocking the DNA repair mechanisms from removing the chemotherapy-mediated DNA damage. In particular, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) involves more than thirty protein-protein interactions and removes DNA adducts caused by platinum-based chemotherapy. The excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1)-xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group A (XPA) protein (XPA-ERCC1) complex seems to be one of the most promising targets in this pathway. ERCC1 is over expressed in cancer cells and the only known cellular function so far for XPA is to recruit ERCC1 to the damaged point. Here, we build upon our recent advances in identifying inhibitors for this interaction and continue our efforts to rationally design more effective and potent regulators for the NER pathway. We employed in silico drug design techniques to: (1) identify compounds similar to the recently discovered inhibitors, but more effective at inhibiting the XPA-ERCC1 interactions, and (2) identify different scaffolds to develop novel lead compounds. Two known inhibitor structures have been used as starting points for two ligand/structure-hybrid virtual screening approaches. The findings described here form a milestone in discovering novel inhibitors for the NER pathway aiming at improving the efficacy of current platinum-based therapy, by modulating the XPA-ERCC1 interaction. },

  abstract = {Current genome-editing technologies introduce double-stranded (ds) DNA breaks at a target locus as the first step to gene correction. Although most genetic diseases arise from point mutations, current approaches to point mutation correction are inefficient and typically induce an abundance of random insertions and deletions (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response to dsDNA breaks. Here we report the development of 'base editing', a new approach to genome editing that enables the direct, irreversible conversion of one target DNA base into another in a programmable manner, without requiring dsDNA backbone cleavage or a donor template. We engineered fusions of CRISPR/Cas9 and a cytidine deaminase enzyme that retain the ability to be programmed with a guide RNA, do not induce dsDNA breaks, and mediate the direct conversion of cytidine to uridine, thereby effecting a C→T (or G→A) substitution. The resulting 'base editors' convert cytidines within a window of approximately five nucleotides, and can efficiently correct a variety of point mutations relevant to human disease. In four transformed human and murine cell lines, second- and third-generation base editors that fuse uracil glycosylase inhibitor, and that use a Cas9 nickase targeting the non-edited strand, manipulate the cellular DNA repair response to favour desired base-editing outcomes, resulting in permanent correction of ~15-75% of total cellular DNA with minimal (typically ≤1%) indel formation. Base editing expands the scope and efficiency of genome editing of point mutations.},

  abstract = {The bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system allows sequence-specific gene editing in many organisms and holds promise as a tool to generate models of human diseases, for example, in human pluripotent stem cells. CRISPR/Cas9 introduces targeted double-stranded breaks (DSBs) with high efficiency, which are typically repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) resulting in nonspecific insertions, deletions or other mutations (indels). DSBs may also be repaired by homology-directed repair (HDR) using a DNA repair template, such as an introduced single-stranded oligo DNA nucleotide (ssODN), allowing knock-in of specific mutations. Although CRISPR/Cas9 is used extensively to engineer gene knockouts through NHEJ, editing by HDR remains inefficient and can be corrupted by additional indels, preventing its widespread use for modelling genetic disorders through introducing disease-associated mutations. Furthermore, targeted mutational knock-in at single alleles to model diseases caused by heterozygous mutations has not been reported. Here we describe a CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing framework that allows selective introduction of mono- and bi-allelic sequence changes with high efficiency and accuracy. We show that HDR accuracy is increased dramatically by incorporating silent CRISPR/Cas-blocking mutations along with pathogenic mutations, and establish a method termed 'CORRECT' for scarless genome editing. By characterizing and exploiting a stereotyped inverse relationship between a mutation's incorporation rate and its distance to the DSB, we achieve predictable control of zygosity. Homozygous introduction requires a guide RNA targeting close to the intended mutation, whereas heterozygous introduction can be accomplished by distance-dependent suboptimal mutation incorporation or by use of mixed repair templates. Using this approach, we generated human induced pluripotent stem cells with heterozygous and homozygous dominant early onset Alzheimer's disease-causing mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP(Swe)) and presenilin 1 (PSEN1(M146V)) and derived cortical neurons, which displayed genotype-dependent disease-associated phenotypes. Our findings enable efficient introduction of specific sequence changes with CRISPR/Cas9, facilitating study of human disease. },

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae DDT employs two parallel branch pathways to bypass the DNA lesion, namely translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and error-free lesion bypass, which are mediated by sequential modifications of PCNA. Rad5 has been placed in the error-free branch of DDT because it contains an E3 ligase domain required for PCNA polyubiquitination. Rad5 is a multi-functional protein and may also play a role in TLS, since it interacts with the TLS polymerase Rev1. In this study we mapped the Rev1-interaction domain in Rad5 to the amino acid resolution and demonstrated that Rad5 is indeed involved in TLS possibly through recruitment of Rev1. Genetic analyses show that the dual functions of Rad5 can be separated and reconstituted. Crystal structure analysis of the Rad5-Rev1 interaction reveals a consensus RFF motif in the Rad5 N-terminus that binds to a hydrophobic pocket within the C-terminal domain of Rev1 that is highly conserved in eukaryotes. This study indicates that Rad5 plays a critical role in pathway choice between TLS and error-free DDT.},

  abstract = {Trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) are tandem arrays of three nucleotides that can expand in length to cause at least 17 inherited human diseases. Somatic expansions in patients can occur in differentiated tissues where DNA replication is limited and cannot be a primary source of somatic mutation. Instead, mouse models of TNR diseases have shown that both inherited and somatic expansions can be suppressed by the loss of certain DNA repair factors. It is generally believed that these repair factors cause misprocessing of TNRs, leading to expansions. Here we extend this idea to show that the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a causative factor in expansions of short TNRs. Mutations that eliminate MRX subunits led to significant suppression of expansions whereas mutations that inactivate Rad51 had only a minor effect. Coupled with previous evidence, this suggests that MRX drives expansions of short TNRs through a process distinct from homologous recombination. The nuclease function of Mre11 was dispensable for expansions, suggesting that expansions do not occur by Mre11-dependent nucleolytic processing of the TNR. Epistasis between MRX and post-replication repair (PRR) was tested. PRR protects against expansions, so a rad5 mutant gave a high expansion rate. In contrast, the mre11 rad5 double mutant gave a suppressed expansion rate, indistinguishable from the mre11 single mutant. This suggests that MRX creates a TNR substrate for PRR. Protein acetylation was also tested as a mechanism regulating MRX activity in expansions. Six acetylation sites were identified in Rad50. Mutation of all six lysine residues to arginine gave partial bypass of a sin3 HDAC mutant, suggesting that Rad50 acetylation is functionally important for Sin3-mediated expansions. Overall we conclude that yeast MRX helps drive expansions of short TNRs by a mechanism distinct from its role in homologous recombination and independent of the nuclease function of Mre11.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED: The CRISPR/Cas9 system enables genome editing and somatic cell genetic screens in mammalian cells. We performed genome-scale loss-of-function screens in 33 cancer cell lines to identify genes essential for proliferation/survival and found a strong correlation between increased gene copy number and decreased cell viability after genome editing. Within regions of copy-number gain, CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of both expressed and unexpressed genes, as well as intergenic loci, led to significantly decreased cell proliferation through induction of a G2 cell-cycle arrest. By examining single-guide RNAs that map to multiple genomic sites, we found that this cell response to CRISPR/Cas9 editing correlated strongly with the number of target loci. These observations indicate that genome targeting by CRISPR/Cas9 elicits a gene-independent antiproliferative cell response. This effect has important practical implications for the interpretation of CRISPR/Cas9 screening data and confounds the use of this technology for the identification of essential genes in amplified regions.
SIGNIFICANCE: We found that the number of CRISPR/Cas9-induced DNA breaks dictates a gene-independent antiproliferative response in cells. These observations have practical implications for using CRISPR/Cas9 to interrogate cancer gene function and illustrate that cancer cells are highly sensitive to site-specific DNA damage, which may provide a path to novel therapeutic strategies.

  abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are dangerous lesions that if not properly repaired can lead to genomic change or cell death. Organisms have developed several pathways and have many factors devoted to repairing DSBs, which broadly occurs by homologous recombination, which relies on an identical or homologous sequence to template repair, or nonhomologous end-joining. Much of our understanding of these repair mechanisms has come from the study of induced DNA cleavage by site-specific endonucleases. In addition to their biological role, these cellular pathways can be co-opted for gene editing to study gene function or for gene therapy or other applications. While the first gene editing experiments were done more than 20 years ago, the recent discovery of RNA-guided endonucleases has simplified approaches developed over the years to make gene editing an approach that is available to the entire biomedical research community. Here, we review DSB repair mechanisms and site-specific cleavage systems that have provided insight into these mechanisms and led to the current gene editing revolution.},

Despite the widespread adoption of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to induce DSBs for genome engineering, the resulting repair products have not been examined in depth. Here, the DNA repair profiles of 223 sites in the human genome demonstrate that the pattern of DNA repair following Cas9 cutting at each site is nonrandom and consistent across experimental replicates, cell lines, and reagent delivery methods. Furthermore, the repair outcomes are determined by the protospacer sequence rather than genomic context, indicating that DNA repair profiling in cell lines can be used to anticipate repair outcomes in primary cells. Chemical inhibition of DNA-PK enabled dissection of the DNA repair profiles into contributions from c-NHEJ and MMEJ.

Optimization of such screens to enhance discovery of candidate genes and minimize false positives is thus a critical aim. Here, we report several sources of error common to pooled genetic screening techniques used in mammalian cell culture systems, and demonstrate methods to eliminate these errors. We find that reverse transcriptase-mediated recombination during retroviral replication can lead to uncoupling of molecular tags, such as DNA barcodes (BCs), from their associated library elements, leading to chimeric proviral genomes in which BCs are paired to incorrect ORFs, shRNAs, etc This effect depends on the length of homologous sequence between unique elements, and can be minimized with careful vector design. Furthermore, we report that residual plasmid DNA from viral packaging procedures can contaminate transduced cells. These plasmids serve as additional copies of the PCR template during library amplification, resulting in substantial inaccuracies in measurement of initial reference populations for screen normalization. The overabundance of template in some samples causes an imbalance between PCR cycles of contaminated and uncontaminated samples, which results in a systematic artifactual depletion of GC-rich library elements. Elimination of contaminating plasmid DNA using the bacterial endonuclease Benzonase can restore faithful measurements of template abundance and minimize GC bias.},

CKS1B codes for a conserved regulatory subunit of cyclin-CDK complexes that function at multiple stages of cell cycle progression. We used a high throughput screening protocol to mimic cancer-related overexpression in a library of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants to identify genes whose functions become essential only when CKS1 is overexpressed, a synthetic dosage lethal (SDL) interaction. Mutations in multiple genes affecting mitotic entry and mitotic exit are highly enriched in the set of SDL interactions. The interactions between Cks1 and the mitotic entry checkpoint genes require the inhibitory activity of Swe1 on the yeast cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), Cdc28. In addition, the SDL interactions of overexpressed CKS1 with mutations in the mitotic exit network are suppressed by modulating expression of the CDK inhibitor Sic1. Mutation of the polo-like kinase Cdc5, which functions in both the mitotic entry and mitotic exit pathways, is lethal in combination with overexpressed CKS1 Therefore we investigated the effect of targeting the human Cdc5 ortholog, PLK1, in breast cancers with various expression levels of human CKS1B Growth inhibition by PLK1 knockdown correlates with increased CKS1B expression in published tumor cell data sets, and this correlation was confirmed using shRNAs against PLK1 in tumor cell lines. In addition, we overexpressed CKS1B in multiple cell lines and found increased sensitivity to PLK1 knockdown and PLK1 drug inhibition. Finally, combined inhibition of WEE1 and PLK1 results in less apoptosis than predicted based on an additive model of the individual inhibitors, showing an epistatic interaction and confirming a prediction of the yeast data. Thus, identification of a yeast SDL interaction uncovers conserved genetic interactions that can affect human cancer cell viability.},

Our programmable deaminases effectively convert specific cytidines to thymidines with 13% efficiency in Escherichia coli and 2.5% in human cells. However, off-target deaminations were detected more than 150 bp away from the target site. Moreover, whole genome sequencing revealed that edited bacterial cells did not harbour chromosomal abnormalities but demonstrated elevated global cytidine deamination at deaminase intrinsic binding sites. Therefore programmable deaminases represent a promising genome editing tool in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Future engineering is required to overcome the processivity and the intrinsic DNA binding affinity of deaminases for safer therapeutic applications.},

Coupled with a uracil-DNA glycosylase inhibitor, dCas9-AIDx converted targeted cytidines specifically to thymines, creating specific point mutations. By targeting BCR-ABL with dCas9-AIDx, we efficiently identified known and new mutations conferring imatinib resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia cells.

Here, we establish an evaluation framework that can be applied to driver gene prediction methods. We used this framework to compare the performance of eight such methods. One of these methods, described here, incorporated a machine-learning-based ratiometric approach. We show that the driver genes predicted by each of the eight methods vary widely. Moreover, the P values reported by several of the methods were inconsistent with the uniform values expected, thus calling into question the assumptions that were used to generate them. Finally, we evaluated the potential effects of unexplained variability in mutation rates on false-positive driver gene predictions.

  abstract = {Break-induced replication (BIR) is an important pathway specializing in repair of one-ended double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). This type of DSB break typically arises at collapsed replication forks or at eroded telomeres. BIR initiates by invasion of a broken DNA end into a homologous template followed by initiation of DNA synthesis that can proceed for hundreds of kilobases. This synthesis is drastically different from S-phase replication in that instead of a replication fork, BIR proceeds via a migrating bubble and is associated with conservative inheritance of newly synthesized DNA. This unusual mode of DNA replication is responsible for frequent genetic instabilities associated with BIR, including hyper-mutagenesis, which can lead to the formation of mutation clusters, extensive loss of heterozygosity, chromosomal translocations, copy-number variations and complex genomic rearrangements. In addition to budding yeast experimental systems that were initially employed to investigate eukaryotic BIR, recent studies in different organisms including humans, have provided multiple examples of BIR initiated within different cellular contexts, including collapsed replication fork and telomere maintenance in the absence of telomerase. In addition, significant progress has been made towards understanding microhomology-mediated BIR (MMBIR) that can promote complex chromosomal rearrangements, including those associated with cancer and those leading to a number of neurological disorders in humans.},

Class 2 CRISPR-Cas systems are streamlined versions, in which a single RNA-bound Cas protein recognizes and cleaves target sequences. The programmable nature of these minimal systems has enabled researchers to repurpose them into a versatile technology that is broadly revolutionizing biological and clinical research. However, current CRISPR-Cas technologies are based solely on systems from isolated bacteria, leaving the vast majority of enzymes from organisms that have not been cultured untapped. Metagenomics, the sequencing of DNA extracted directly from natural microbial communities, provides access to the genetic material of a huge array of uncultivated organisms. Here, using genome-resolved metagenomics, we identify a number of CRISPR-Cas systems, including the first reported Cas9 in the archaeal domain of life, to our knowledge. This divergent Cas9 protein was found in little-studied nanoarchaea as part of an active CRISPR-Cas system. In bacteria, we discovered two previously unknown systems, CRISPR-CasX and CRISPR-CasY, which are among the most compact systems yet discovered. Notably, all required functional components were identified by metagenomics, enabling validation of robust in vivo RNA-guided DNA interference activity in Escherichia coli. Interrogation of environmental microbial communities combined with in vivo experiments allows us to access an unprecedented diversity of genomes, the content of which will expand the repertoire of microbe-based biotechnologies.},

Upon UV irradiation, a slowdown of transcript elongation and restriction of gene activity to the promoter-proximal ∼25 kb is observed. This is associated with a shift from expression of long mRNAs to shorter isoforms, incorporating alternative last exons (ALEs) that are more proximal to the transcription start site. Notably, this includes a shift from a protein-coding ASCC3 mRNA to a shorter ALE isoform of which the RNA, rather than an encoded protein, is critical for the eventual recovery of transcription. The non-coding ASCC3 isoform counteracts the function of the protein-coding isoform, indicating crosstalk between them. Thus, the ASCC3 gene expresses both coding and non-coding transcript isoforms with opposite effects on transcription recovery after UV-induced DNA damage.},

Here we report the development of five C to T (or G to A) base editors that use natural and engineered Cas9 variants with different protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) specificities to expand the number of sites that can be targeted by base editing 2.5-fold. Additionally, we engineered base editors containing mutated cytidine deaminase domains that narrow the width of the editing window from ∼5 nucleotides to as little as 1-2 nucleotides. We thereby enabled discrimination of neighboring C nucleotides, which would otherwise be edited with similar efficiency, and doubled the number of disease-associated target Cs able to be corrected preferentially over nearby non-target Cs.},

Here we modify digested-genome sequencing (Digenome-seq) to assess the specificity of a programmable deaminase composed of a Cas9 nickase (nCas9) and the deaminase APOBEC1 in the human genome. Genomic DNA is treated with the base editor and a mixture of DNA-modifying enzymes in vitro to produce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at uracil-containing sites. Off-target sites are then computationally identified from whole genome sequencing data. Testing seven different single guide RNAs (sgRNAs), we find that the rAPOBEC1-nCas9 base editor is highly specific, inducing cytosine-to-uracil conversions at only 18 ± 9 sites in the human genome for each sgRNA. Digenome-seq is sensitive enough to capture off-target sites with a substitution frequency of 0.1%. Notably, off-target sites of the base editors are often different from those of Cas9 alone, calling for independent assessment of their genome-wide specificities.},

First, we greatly reduce off-target base editing by installing mutations into our third-generation base editor (BE3) to generate a high-fidelity base editor (HF-BE3). Next, we purify and deliver BE3 and HF-BE3 as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes into mammalian cells, establishing DNA-free base editing. RNP delivery of BE3 confers higher specificity even than plasmid transfection of HF-BE3, while maintaining comparable on-target editing levels.

  abstract = {Defects in DNA repair can result in oncogenic genomic instability. Cancers occurring from DNA repair defects were once thought to be limited to rare inherited mutations (such as BRCA1 or 2). It now appears that a clinically significant fraction of cancers have acquired DNA repair defects. DNA repair pathways operate in related networks, and cancers arising from loss of one DNA repair component typically become addicted to other repair pathways to survive and proliferate. Drug inhibition of the rescue repair pathway prevents the repair-deficient cancer cell from replicating, causing apoptosis (termed synthetic lethality). However, the selective pressure of inhibiting the rescue repair pathway can generate further mutations that confer resistance to the synthetic lethal drugs. Many such drugs currently in clinical use inhibit PARP1, a repair component to which cancers arising from inherited BRCA1 or 2 mutations become addicted. It is now clear that drugs inducing synthetic lethality may also be therapeutic in cancers with acquired DNA repair defects, which would markedly broaden their applicability beyond treatment of cancers with inherited DNA repair defects. Here we review how each DNA repair pathway can be attacked therapeutically and evaluate DNA repair components as potential drug targets to induce synthetic lethality. Clinical use of drugs targeting DNA repair will markedly increase when functional and genetic loss of repair components are consistently identified.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: ImageJ is an image analysis program extensively used in the biological sciences and beyond. Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that spans the biological and physical sciences. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science.
RESULTS: We rewrote the entire ImageJ codebase, engineering a redesigned plugin mechanism intended to facilitate extensibility at every level, with the goal of creating a more powerful tool that continues to serve the existing community while addressing a wider range of scientific requirements. This next-generation ImageJ, called {"}ImageJ2{"} in places where the distinction matters, provides a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace.
CONCLUSIONS: Scientific imaging benefits from open-source programs that advance new method development and deployment to a diverse audience. ImageJ has continuously evolved with this idea in mind; however, new and emerging scientific requirements have posed corresponding challenges for ImageJ's development. The described improvements provide a framework engineered for flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well as accommodate future needs. Future efforts will focus on implementing new algorithms in this framework and expanding collaborations with other popular scientific software suites.},

High-throughput technologies are now broadly accessible but their assay development from baseline remains resource-intensive and challenging. Focusing on this assay development process, we here describe a target discovery screen using pooled shRNA libraries and next-generation sequencing (NGS) deconvolution in a cell line model of Ewing sarcoma. In a strategy designed for comparative and synthetic lethal studies, we screened for targets specific to the A673 Ewing sarcoma cell line. Methods, results and pitfalls are described for the entire multi-step screening procedure, from lentiviral shRNA delivery to bioinformatics analysis, illustrating a complete model workflow. We demonstrate that successful studies are feasible from the first assay performance and independent of specialized screening units. Furthermore, we show that a resource-saving screen depth of 100-fold average shRNA representation can suffice to generate reproducible target hits despite heterogeneity in the derived datasets. Because statistical analysis methods are debatable for such datasets, we created ProFED, an analysis package designed to facilitate descriptive data analysis and hit calling using an aim-oriented profile filtering approach. In its versatile design, this open-source online tool provides fast and easy analysis of shRNA and other count-based datasets to complement other analytical algorithms.},

  abstract = {Despite the development of novel drugs, alkylating agents remain an important component of therapy in multiple myeloma (MM). DNA repair processes contribute towards sensitivity to alkylating agents and therefore we here evaluate the role of nucleotide excision repair (NER), which is involved in the removal of bulky adducts and DNA crosslinks in MM. We first evaluated NER activity using a novel functional assay and observed a heterogeneous NER efficiency in MM cell lines and patient samples. Using next-generation sequencing data, we identified that expression of the canonical NER gene, excision repair cross-complementation group 3 (ERCC3), significantly impacted the outcome in newly diagnosed MM patients treated with alkylating agents. Next, using small RNA interference, stable knockdown and overexpression, and small-molecule inhibitors targeting xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group B (XPB), the DNA helicase encoded by ERCC3, we demonstrate that NER inhibition significantly increases sensitivity and overcomes resistance to alkylating agents in MM. Moreover, inhibiting XPB leads to the dual inhibition of NER and transcription and is particularly efficient in myeloma cells. Altogether, we show that NER impacts alkylating agents sensitivity in myeloma cells and identify ERCC3 as a potential therapeutic target in MM.},

Many enzymes with replication fork reversal activity have DNA-unwinding activity as well, but none of the fork reversal enzymes in the SWI/SNF family shows a separate DNA-unwinding activity, raising the question of how they initiate the remodeling process. Here, we found ATP binding to Rad5 induces the unwinding of the leading arm of the replication fork and proximally positions the leading and lagging arms. This facilitates the spontaneous remodeling of the replication fork into a four-way junction. Once the four-way junction is formed, Rad5 migrates the four-way junction at a speed of 7.1 ± 0.14 nt/s. The 3' end anchoring of the leading arm by Rad5's HIRAN domain is critical for both branch migration and the recovery of the three-way junction, but not for the structural transition to the four-way junction.},

  abstract = {Helicase-like transcription factor (HLTF) is a central mediator of the DNA damage response and maintains genome stability by regressing stalled replication forks. The N-terminal HIRAN domain binds specifically to the 3'-end of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and disrupting this function interferes with fork regression in vitro as well as replication fork progression in cells under replication stress. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which the HIRAN-ssDNA interaction facilitates fork remodeling. Our results indicated that HIRAN capture of a denatured nascent leading 3'-end directs specific binding of HLTF to forks. DNase footprinting revealed that HLTF binds to the parental duplex ahead of the fork and at the leading edge behind the fork. Moreover, we found that the HIRAN domain is important for initiating regression of forks when both nascent strands are at the junction, but is dispensable when forks contain ssDNA regions on either template strand. We also found that HLTF catalyzes fork restoration from a partially regressed structure in a HIRAN-dependent manner. Thus, HIRAN serves as a substrate-recognition domain to properly orient the ATPase motor domain at stalled and regressed forks and initiates fork remodeling by guiding formation of a four-way junction. We discuss how these activities compare with those of two related fork remodelers, SWI/SNF-related, matrix-associated, actin-dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily A-like 1 (SMARCAL1) and zinc finger RANBP2 type-containing 3 (ZRANB3) to provide insight into their nonredundant roles in DNA damage tolerance.},

However, the idea that replication forks would form at origins of DNA replication and proceed without impairment to copy the chromosomes has proven naive. It is now clear that replication forks stall frequently as a result of encounters between the replication machinery and template damage, slow-moving or paused transcription complexes, unrelieved positive superhelical tension, covalent protein-DNA complexes, and as a result of cellular stress responses. These stalled forks are a major source of genome instability. The cell has developed many strategies for ensuring that these obstructions to DNA replication do not result in loss of genetic information, including DNA damage tolerance mechanisms such as lesion skipping, whereby the replisome jumps the lesion and continues downstream; template switching both behind template damage and at the stalled fork; and the error-prone pathway of translesion synthesis.},

Lagging-strand lesions are bypassed without delay, leaving daughter-strand gaps roughly the size of an Okazaki fragment. In contrast, leading-strand polymerase stalling significantly impacts replication fork progression. We reveal that the core replisome itself can bypass leading-strand damage by re-priming synthesis beyond it. Surprisingly, this restart activity is rare, mainly due to inefficient leading-strand re-priming, rather than single-stranded DNA exposure or primer extension. We find several unanticipated mechanistic distinctions between leading- and lagging-strand priming that we propose control the replisome's initial response to DNA damage. Notably, leading-strand restart was specifically stimulated by RPA depletion, which can occur under conditions of replication stress. Our results have implications for pathway choice at stalled forks and priming at DNA replication origins.},

Whereas some cell types are amenable to genome engineering, genomes of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been difficult to engineer, with reduced efficiencies relative to tumour cell lines or mouse embryonic stem cells3-13. Here, using hPSC lines with stable integration of Cas9 or transient delivery of Cas9-ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), we achieved an average insertion or deletion (indel) efficiency greater than 80%. This high efficiency of indel generation revealed that double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by Cas9 are toxic and kill most hPSCs. In previous studies, the toxicity of Cas9 in hPSCs was less apparent because of low transfection efficiency and subsequently low DSB induction3. The toxic response to DSBs was P53/TP53-dependent, such that the efficiency of precise genome engineering in hPSCs with a wild-type P53 gene was severely reduced. Our results indicate that Cas9 toxicity creates an obstacle to the high-throughput use of CRISPR/Cas9 for genome engineering and screening in hPSCs. Moreover, as hPSCs can acquire P53 mutations14, cell replacement therapies using CRISPR/Cas9-enginereed hPSCs should proceed with caution, and such engineered hPSCs should be monitored for P53 function.},

Despite its remarkable efficiency, most tumors show intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. The primary biological target of cisplatin is genomic DNA, and it causes a plethora of DNA lesions that block transcription and replication. These cisplatin-induced DNA lesions strongly induce cell death if they are not properly repaired or processed. To counteract cisplatin-induced DNA damage, cells use an intricate network of mechanisms, including DNA damage repair and translesion synthesis. In this review, we describe how cisplatin-induced DNA lesions are repaired or tolerated by cells and focus on the pivotal role of DNA repair and tolerance mechanisms in tumor resistance to cisplatin. In fact, several recent clinical findings have correlated the tumor cell status of DNA repair/translesion synthesis with patient response to cisplatin treatment. Furthermore, these mechanisms provide interesting targets for pharmacological modulation that can increase the efficiency of cisplatin chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {Background: Mutations in KRAS are frequent in human cancer, yet effective targeted therapeutics for these cancers are still lacking. Attempts to drug the MEK kinases downstream of KRAS have had limited success in clinical trials. Understanding the specific genomic vulnerabilities of KRAS driven cancers may uncover novel patient- tailored treatment options.
  Methods: We first searched for synthetic lethal (SL) genetic interactions with mutant RAS in yeast with the ultimate aim to identify novel cancer-specific targets for therapy. Our method used selective ploidy ablation, which enables replication of cancer-specific gene expression changes in the yeast gene disruption library. Second, we used a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screen in KRAS mutant human colon cancer cells to understand the mechanistic connection between the synthetic lethal interaction discovered in yeast and downstream RAS signaling in human cells. Results: We identify loss of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress sensor IRE1 as synthetic lethal with activated RAS mutants in yeast. In KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cell lines, genetic ablation of the human ortholog of IRE1, ERN1, does not affect growth but sensitizes to MEK inhibition. However, an ERN1 kinase inhibitor failed to show synergy with MEK inhibition, suggesting that a non-kinase function of ERN1 confers MEK inhibitor resistance. To investigate how ERN1 modulates MEK inhibitor responses, we performed genetic screens in ERN1 knockout KRAS mutant colon cancer cells to identify genes whose inactivation confers resistance to MEK inhibition. This genetic screen identified multiple negative regulators of JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) /JUN signaling. Consistently, compounds targeting JNK/MAPK8 or TAK1/MAP3K7, which relay signals from ERN1 to JUN, display synergy with MEK inhibition.
  Conclusions: We identify the ERN1-JNK-JUN pathway as a novel regulator of MEK inhibitor response in KRAS mutant colon cancer. The notion that multiple signaling pathways can activate JUN may explain why KRAS mutant tumor cells are traditionally seen as highly refractory to MEK inhibitor therapy. Our findings emphasize the need for the development of new therapeutics targeting JUN activating kinases, TAK1 and JNK, to sensitize KRAS mutant cancer cells to MEK inhibitors.},
